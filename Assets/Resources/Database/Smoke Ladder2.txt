Using this spell, you can mold and shape ordinary smoke into a misty ladder.
Reaching into the smoke given off by a fire, you cast the spell while shaping the ladder.
The ladder weighs virtually nothing, and you can easily handle a smoke ladder of any length.
Furthermore, the ladder is always steady and rigid; it need not be supported or leaned against an object.
You simply place it in the desired position and climb.
You can extend the spell's duration by casting the spell again on the smoke ladder.
Focus: A large fire of green wood.
