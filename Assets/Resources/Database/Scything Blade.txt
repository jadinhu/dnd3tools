<b>Components:</b>

 <b>Target:</b> You

 	
<b>You strike at one foe with a long, high backhand cut, then make a quick turn to continue the stroke against another nearby enemy.</b>
	
You swing your weapon in a wide, deadly arc. With your supreme skill and martial training, you aim your attack so that as you strike one opponent, you set yourself up perfectly to make a second attack against a different foe. As your weapon strikes one opponent, it cuts into him, then ricochets to your second target.
	
If the first melee attack you make during your turn hits, you can immediately make a free attack at your highest attack bonus against a different enemy that you threaten. You can only gain one free attack each time you initiate this maneuver, regardless of how many successful attacks you make in this round.
