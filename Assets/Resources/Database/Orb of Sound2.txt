<b>Symbols recognizable as musical notation � ;the visual representation of sound � ;appear in midair within the curve of your palm accompanied by the fractious sounds they represent. The notes begin to whirl and stretch, forming into a spherical whirlwind of cacophonic chaos, as you make ready to release the spell. At last, you send the sphere of noise toward your chosen target.</b>
