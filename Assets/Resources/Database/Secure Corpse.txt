This spell turns your holy symbol into a magical receptacle capable of holding one creature's corpse.
The corpse must be within range of the spell, in which case it is transformed into divine energy.
The energy is then drawn into the holy symbol, and the corpse is placed in stasis (as the gentle repose spell) for the duration of the spell.
The caster can release the corpse from the holy symbol by dismissing the spell.
If the spell ends or is dismissed, or if the holy symbol is destroyed, the contained corpse materializes in a square adjacent to the holy symbol's present or last location.
