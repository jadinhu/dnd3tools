A touch from your hand, which crackles with black energy, weakens the life force of living creatures.
Each touch channels negative energy that bestows one negative level on the target and grants you 5 temporary hit points.
Both the negative level and the temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour.
A target's successful Fortitude save negates the negative level and prevents you from gaining the temporary hit points.
You can use this melee touch attack once per round for a number of rounds equal to your level.
Any charges of the spell not used by the time the duration expires are lost.
An undead creature you touch instead gains 5 temporary hit points and you lose a like amount (no save).
Temporary hit points gained in this way last for up to 1 hour.
