This spell allows you to soar on a magic chariot formed of cloud.
When you cast the spell, you and any willing allies you are touching lift into the air on a small cloud and then fly away in whatever direction you desire.
You fly at the incredible speed of 10 miles per minute, so that over the spell's duration you can cover a distance of 100 miles.
You and your passengers feel none of the effects of this swift movement, and the ride is perfectly steady and calm ï¿½ ;even in the worst weather.
At the end of the spell, the cloud settles gently to the ground and disappears.
Material Component: A small ball of cotton.
