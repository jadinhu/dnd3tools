This spell awakens a humanoid-shaped construct to humanlike sentience.
The spell does not work on constructs that are only constructs temporarily (such as objects affected by an animate objects spell).
The awakened creature is independent of both you and the being who originally made it, though it is initially friendly toward both you and its maker.
Material Component: The brain of a humanoid that has been dead less than 8 hours.
XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
