You turn the bones and hard tissue of the subject to mush, making him a strange sort of oozelike creature.
He immediately collapses into a heap, lacking the ability to maintain his previous shape.
His Dexterity becomes 1, his speed becomes Swim 10 ft., and he loses the ability to attack, speak, carry objects, or cast spells with somatic components.
He can still use spell-like and supernatural abilities.
He cannot be flanked and is immune to critical hits.
His equipment is not affected.
This spell is normally used as a punishment or to disable opponents without killing them.
