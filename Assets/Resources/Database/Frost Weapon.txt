You imbue a weapon with icy cold, granting it a power similar to the frost special ability.
A frost weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit.
If cast on a bow, crossbow, or sling, the spell bestows the cold energy upon the weapon's ammunition.
This ability stacks with the frost special ability, but not with itself.
Material Component: A drop of water.
