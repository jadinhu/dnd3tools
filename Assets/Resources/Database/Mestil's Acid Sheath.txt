You enclose yourself in a fluid sheath of acid that does not harm you.
You can breathe normally and cast spells while the acid sheath is present.
Any creature striking you with its body deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points +2 points per caster level of acid damage.
Weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.
The acid sheath does not protect you against other attack forms, such as fire.
Any creature you are riding automatically takes damage every round as if you were touching it with a corrosive grasp.
The mount tries to remove the source of pain, requiring a Ride check (DC 30) each round for you to remain mounted.
You may make melee touch attacks as if you were using a corrosive grasp spell.
A creature that swallows you does not take damage from this spell if its stomach inflicts acid damage.
Material Component: A handful of fire ants (alive or dead).
Focus: A glass sculpture of a humanoid.
