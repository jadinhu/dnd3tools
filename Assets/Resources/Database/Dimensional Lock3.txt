You create a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks physical extradimensional travel.
Forms of movement barred include astral projection, blink,
dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate,maze, phasing,
plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like and psionic abilities.
Once the spell is in place, extradimensional travel into or out of the affected area is not possible.
The dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms such as a basilisk's gaze.
It also does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
