This spell makes your familiar tougher, granting it 2d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor.
It also has a 25% chance to avoid extra damage from sneak attacks or critical hits (though such attacks still deal normal damage if successful).
Temporary hit points gained in this fashion last for up to 1 hour.
