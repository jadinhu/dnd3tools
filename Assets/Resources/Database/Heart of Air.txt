You feel light as a feather, as if the slightest breeze might knock you about.
This spell converts part of your body into elemental air, freeing you somewhat from the bonds of gravity.
You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on Jump checks, and if you have a fly speed, that speed gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus.
Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a feather fall effect (as the spell) on yourself as an immediate action.
This benefit lasts for 1 round per level, at the end of which time the spell's entire effect ends.
If heart of air is active on you at the same time as heart of earth, heart of fire, or heart of water, you gain light fortification.
If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you become immune to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.
