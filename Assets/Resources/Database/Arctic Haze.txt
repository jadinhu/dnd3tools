A bank of fog composed entirely of tiny, razor-sharp ice shards billows out from the targeted point.
The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
A creature 5 feet away has concealment (20% miss chance).
Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).
In addition, the sharp ice particles tear the skin of those moving through the area, causing 4 points of damage per round, half of which is cold damage.
A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.
Dispersing the fog in this manner, however, causes damage to those within its area as the icy shards whip past.
A strong wind causes 4 points of damage per round (half cold); a severe wind causes 8 points of damage (half cold).
