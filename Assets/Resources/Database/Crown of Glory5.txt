Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against you must succeed on a Will save to do so.
Any creature that fails this save the first time it attempts a hostile action is enthralled for the duration of the spell (as the enthrall spell) as long as it is in the spell's area, and it will not try to leave the area on its own.
