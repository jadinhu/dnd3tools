You protect the target against mind-affecting effects, giving all affected creatures a +3 sacred bonus on saving throws against such attacks.
The spell also prevents them from being magically compelled to harm you or anyone else affected by this spell.
Any attempt to make a subject do so (whether the originating effect occurred before or after this spell was cast) counts as a suicidal order, triggering appropriate responses and possibly ending the controlling spell.
If a subject willingly attempts to harm you, the spell is broken for that creature immediately.
The subjects gain the benefits of a bless spell as long as you are in sight of them.
