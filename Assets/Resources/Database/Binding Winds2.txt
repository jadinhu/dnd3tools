You create a flurry of air to encircle and hold your target.
The binding winds do not move.
They become a physical barrier surrounding the subject.
The target may act normally, except that she cannot move from her current location.
The winds carry her voice away, so she can speak but will not be heard, and she cannot hear anything but the roar of the winds.
Furthermore, no sonic or language-dependent spells or effects may be cast into or out of the binding winds (though spells cast by the caster upon himself function normally).
Ranged attacks made into or out of the binding winds suffer a -2 penalty.
Binding winds hold flying creatures in midair.
