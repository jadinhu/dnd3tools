<b>Translocation Trick</b>(Spell Compendium, p. 222)

Conjuration [Teleportation]
 <b>Level:</b>  Sorcerer 4,  Wizard 4,    
<b>Components:</b>V, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
 <b>Target:</b> You and one creature
 <b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes/level
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates; see text
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes

 	
<b>You utter the words, and in an instant you and your target are switched ï¿½ ;you take its position and form, and it appears where you had stood moments before, looking to others as you appear.</b>
	
You and the other target switch locations, as if simultaneously using <b>dimension door</b> spells (PH 221) and exchange appearances, as if using <b>disguise self</b> spells (PH 222) to appear as each other. Your target can negate this spell with a successful saving throw.
	
If you or your target exceed the capacity of the dimension door spell or if you and your target have bodies that are so different that the disguise self spell could not disguise you as your target, this spell fails.
	
Magic that penetrates disguises (such as true seeing) reveals the identities of you and your target. Otherwise, you are considered to be disguised as your target and vice versa for the duration of the spell. You get a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the target.
	
When the spell ends, you and your target revert to your true appearances in your current locations. You do not switch places again.
