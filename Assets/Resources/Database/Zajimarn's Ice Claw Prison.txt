Similar to Bigby's grasping hand, this spell creates a Medium-size reptilian claw made of ice.
The ice claw gets one grappling attack per round.
Its attack bonus to make contact is your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively), +7 for the claw's Strength score (24).
Its grapple check is this same figure.
When the claw succeeds at a grapple, it inflicts normal grapple damage (1d3 points plus its Strength modifier).
You can direct it to damage or pin its target on your turn as a free action.
On any round that the claw is grappling a target, it deals 1d8 points of cold damage in addition to any other damage it causes.
The claw can attack on the round it appears.
Directing it to change targets is a standard action.
It always attacks from your direction and does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.
The claw has as many hit points as you do when undamaged and is AC 20 (+10 natural).
It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that do not deal damage do not affect it.
The claw cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field.
It suffers the full effects of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere.
The claw makes saving throws as if it were you.
Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it.
It is immune to cold but takes double damage from fire.
Focus: A white leather glove and a piece of clear rock crystal.
