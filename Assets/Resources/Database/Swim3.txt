<b>Making the sound of crashing waves with your throat completes the spell. With a wave of your hand, your subject seems more streamlined, with a hint of webbed appendages.</b>
	
This spell gives the recipient a swim speed of 30 feet (although not the ability to breathe water or hold one's breath beyond normal limits). As long as the creature isn't carrying more than a light load, it can swim without making Swim checks. It also gains a +8 bonus on any Swim checks to perform special actions or avoid hazards, though it still takes the normal penalty for weight carried ( ï¿½ ;1 per 5 pounds). The recipient can choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if rushed or threatened, and can use the run action while swimming if it swims in a straight line.
	
If the creature is carrying more than a light load, it must make Swim checks to move (taking the normal penalty for weight carried), but all other benefits of the spell still apply.
	
Material Component: A goldfish scale.
