<b>Your skill at arms and overwhelming power force your opponent to falter at a fatal moment. As the foe attempts to recover from your devastating strike, your allies rush in to finish what you have started.</b>
	
You make a mighty attack that knocks your opponent into a defenseless position, granting your allies a moment to move into a better position. If your attack lands true, it leaves your enemy momentarily shaken by its tremendous impact.
	
As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. If your attack hits, you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage. In addition, each ally adjacent to the target can take an immediate 5-foot step that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
