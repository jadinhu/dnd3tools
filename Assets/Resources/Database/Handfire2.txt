You surround your hand with winking motes of light that resemble a cluster of constantly renewed sparks.
The lights can be any color you choose, but the color cannot be changed once the spell is cast.
Handfire provides illumination equal to that of a candle, but it does not give off heat and cannot ignite objects.
Handfire can be used as a melee touch attack up to once per two caster levels.
Against a living creature, this attack deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
Against undead, handfire deals 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
It has no effect on targets that are neither living nor undead (such as constructs).
