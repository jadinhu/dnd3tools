Improvisation makes available a floating &quot;pool&quot; of bonus points that the caster can use as desired to improve his or her odds of success at various tasks.
This bonus pool consists of 2 points per level, which the caster can divide as desired among attack rolls and skill or ability checks.
The caster must declare any bonus-point usage before the appropriate rolls are made.
Used points disappear from the pool, and any points remaining when the spell ends are wasted.
These points count as luck bonuses for purposes of stacking.
For example, a 14th-level bard pauses from chasing a pickpocket to cast improvisation.
Over the next 14 rounds, he could add +8 to a Spot check, +6 to a Climb check, and +7 to two of his attack rolls.
Material Component: A pair of dice.
