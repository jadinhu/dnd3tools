You transfer some of your life essence to another creature, healing it.
You may heal up to 1d6 points per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), and must decide how many dice to roll when you cast the spell.
You take damage equal to the amount your target was healed.
This spell cannot heal a target of more than your current hit points +10, which is enough to kill you.
