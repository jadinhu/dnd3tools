You cast this spell upon one or more gems, imbuing them with healing energy.
The gems leap from your hand, fly to the target, and begin orbiting the target's head like ioun stones.
Each warding gem is a receptacle that holds 10 hp.
The target can, as a free action, access the healing energy inside a warding gem; the energy is released as a purple-white arc of divine power that unerringly strikes the target, healing 10 points of damage.
The target cannot choose to absorb only a portion of a warding gem's healing power.
A warding gem depleted of its healing energy instantly turns to dust.
At the end of the spell's duration, any unspent warding gems lose their healing power and fall to the ground; these can be reused for a later spell.
A single creature can have no more than five warding gems encircling it at one time.
A warding gem has AC 24, hardness 10, and 10 hp; if it's destroyed, any healing power contained within is lost.
Material Components:One 500-gp gem for each warding gem created.
