By casting druid grove, you reshape a living tree so that it can contain a spell.
Thereafter, you can access this stored spell at any rime, as if the tree were a very large, immobile scroll.
In conjunction with druid grove, you can cast druid spells totaling no more than one-third of your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th).
Instead of taking effect, these companion spells are stored in trees within the area.
Each tree can hold only one spell.
Druid grove and the companion spells must all be cast during the same uninterrupted ritual.
The 10-minute casting time noted above is the minimum for the entire ritual, if any of the companion spells take longer than 10 minutes to cast, use the actual total casting time instead.
By touching the tree that contains a companion spell (a standard action), you can activate that spell instantaneously.
You must make any decisions about its effect (such as targeting and direction) upon touching the tree.
You may have only one druid grove in effect at a time.
If you cast a second druid grove before the first expires or is fully discharged, the first is dispelled.
A tree affected by druid grove detects as magical, but the detection process does not harm the tree in any way.
