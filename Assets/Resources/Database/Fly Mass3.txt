As fly, except this spell confers the power of flight upon all targeted creatures.
Once a creature receives the spell, it must remain within 30 feet of at least one other recipient, or the spell is broken for that creature.
(If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other loses the ability to fly.
If both are moving away from each other, they both become unable to fly when the distance between them exceeds 30 feet).
