With a sudden flash, you find yourself standing on the other side of the battle, leaving a smoking trail behind you.
You transform yourself into a line of lightning, similar to that created by the lightning bolt spell.
This line can be of any length from 10 feet to 60 feet, measured in 5-foot increments.
You reappear in any square adjacent to the last square entered by the line, along with any gear worn or carried (up to a maximum of your heavy load limit).
You can't bring along other creatures except for your familiar.
The line deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to anything in its area.
A successful Reflex save halves this damage, and spell resistance applies.
