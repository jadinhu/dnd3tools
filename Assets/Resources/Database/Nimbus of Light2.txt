<b>A glittering corona of sunlight surrounds your body at a few inches distance ï¿½ ;until you release it as a focused blast of divine energy.</b>
	
The nimbus of light around you glows like a lantern, providing bright illumination in a 30-foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 30 feet) from you.
	
As a move action, you can coalesce the energy from a nimbus of light around your outstretched arm, and then as a standard action fling it toward a foe within 30 feet. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the energy to strike a target. A nimbus of light deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per round that has elapsed since you cast the spell (maximum 1d8 + caster level). Attacking with a nimbus of light ends the spell, whether your ranged touch attack is successful or not.
