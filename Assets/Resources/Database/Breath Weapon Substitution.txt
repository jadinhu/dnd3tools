Choose one type of energy other than that normally associated with your breath weapon: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.
You can modify your breath weapon to use the selected energy type instead of its normal energy type.
For example, a mature adult red dragon whose breath weapon normally deals 14d10 points of fire damage could use this spell to produce a cone dealing 14d10 points of acid damage instead.
The modification applies only to the breath produced as part of the casting.
When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy, it is a spell of that type.
For example, breath weapon substitution is an acid spell when you cast it to change your breath weapon to deal acid damage.
