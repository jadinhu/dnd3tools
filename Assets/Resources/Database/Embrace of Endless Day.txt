<b>In a burst of holy light, you gift your companion with the faintest spark of the divine. His eyes glow dimly with sacred power.</b>
	
You imbue the target with positive energy which he can then release, in controlled amounts or all at once. You bestow 3 &quot;points&quot; of positive energy per caster level (maximum 30).
	
The target can expend this energy to heal with a touch, or harm creatures vulnerable to positive energy, as a paladin's lay on hands ability. Each &quot;point&quot; of positive energy removes or deals 1 point of damage.
	
The target also gains a +1 sacred bonus on saves against necromantic and death effects until all the bestowed energy has been expended.
