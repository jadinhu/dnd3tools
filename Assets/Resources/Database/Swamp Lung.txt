<b>You take a deep breath and feel the power of the spell surround you. Choosing your target, you unleash the spell's energy. A sea-green halo forms around your target's head. Moments later, the targeted creature begins coughing up water.</b>
	
This spell causes stagnant swamp water to flood the target's lungs. If the target is unable to breathe water, it must cough it out. If it makes the save, then this expulsion is done with little effort. If it fails the save, the creature falls prone in a coughing fit for 1d6 rounds and is helpless during that time. Furthermore, on a failed save, the subject contracts filth fever (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 292). Creatures able to breathe water must make the Fortitude save in order to avoid the disease, but are otherwise unaffected.
