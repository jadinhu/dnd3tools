You create a glowing mace of force that appears in your hand.
You must make a melee touch attack to strike a target with the mace.
If it hits, the mace of Odo deals 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
An undead target takes an additional +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +10).
Any creature struck by the mace must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round.
You may attack once with the mace of Odo on the same round that you summoned it.
The mace occupies your hand but does not disappear if you cast another spell.
If you are targeted with a spell while holding the mace, you may choose to have the mace absorb that spell.
When the mace strikes a creature, or is used to absorb a spell, or is removed from your grasp for any reason, it vanishes.
The point in space where it vanished glows as though under the effect of a light spell for the remainder of the duration.
