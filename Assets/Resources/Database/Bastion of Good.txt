A nimbus of light surrounds you, protecting you and those around you from spell effects and the attacks of evil creatures.
The aura excludes all spell effects of up to 3rd level, exactly as a minor globe of invulnerability does.
In addition, the nimbus protects creatures within it as a magic circle against evil at double strength.
Warded creatures gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves against attacks from evil creatures, and they are protected from possession, mental control, and bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures.
Abstinence Component: You must fast for 24 hours before casting this spell.
