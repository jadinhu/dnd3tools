You conjure a band of energy that slowly squeezes your opponent.
As the band tightens, it restricts his movement and eventually holds him in place, rigid with paralysis.
This spell has one effect on an opponent when you begin casting it.
At the beginning of your next turn, when you finish casting
the spell, it has a second effect.
When you start casting this spell, your target takes a -2 penalty on attacks, checks, saves, and AC.
He also takes a 20-foot penalty to speed.
This effect does not allow a saving throw, but spell resistance applies.
If you fail to overcome the target's spell resistance, you immediately stop casting the spell, and the secondary effect does not take place.
When you complete the casting of this spell, your target must make a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed.
Even if the target makes this saving throw, this spell's initial effect continues to affect him for the spell's duration.
This spell's duration begins after you have completed casting it.
