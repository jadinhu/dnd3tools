You can concentrate upon a specific individual who you believe to bear a necrotic cyst (see spell of the same name), and hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there.
Distance is not a factor, but the spell fails if the individual no longer bears the cyst or if the cyst bearer is no longer on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.
If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing.
If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect.
Lead sheeting or magical protection (such as antimagic field,
mind blank, or nondetection) blocks the spell, and you sense that the spell is so blocked.
You may cast the following spells through necrotic scrying: comprehend languages,magic mouth,message, read magic,
tongues, and darkvision.
Focus: Caster must possess a mother cyst (see page 28).
