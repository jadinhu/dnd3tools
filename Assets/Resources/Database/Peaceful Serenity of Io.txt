You croon an ancient, wordless melody, and a sense of calm settles about those around you.
You fill the subject with the peacefulness and balance of Io's great Song, granting it a +4 morale bonus on Concentration checks, and saves against compulsions and fear effects for 10 minutes.
If the subject is under the influence of compulsion or fear effects when receiving the spell, those effects are suppressed for the duration of the spell.
