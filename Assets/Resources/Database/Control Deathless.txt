This spell enables you to command deathless creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice, and the creatures understand you no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible (in the area of a <b>silence</b> spell, for instance), the controlled deathless do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the controlled deathless revert to their normal behavior. Intelligent deathless remember that you controlled them.
