This spell functions like <b>sign of sealing</b>, except that it can also be used to seal an open space (such as a corridor or an archway), creating a magical barrier of force that repels any creature attempting to pass. In addition, doors and objects protected by a greater sign of sealing are strengthened, increasing their hardness by 10 and granting them an extra 5 hit points per caster level. Any object protected by a greater sign of sealing is treated as a magic item for the purpose of making saving throws and gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If its seal is broken, a greater sign of sealing deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) in a 40-foot radius (Reflex half).
	
A greater sign of sealing cannot be passed with a knock spell, but it can be dispelled (DC 15 + the caster level of the sign's creator). It can be disarmed with a DC 31 Disable Device check.
	
Material Component: A crushed emerald worth at least 500 gp.
