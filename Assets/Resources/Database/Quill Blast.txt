Needle-sharp quills emerge from your skin as you cast this spell, then fly outward in every direction when you complete the spell.
Creatures within the spread of a quill blast are hit by one or more quills, depending on their size:
Creatures who make their saves are struck by half as many quills; Tiny or smaller creatures avoid the quills completely.
Each quill inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage and lodges itself in the flesh of any living creature it hits.
Lodged quills impose a -1 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks per quill.
A quill can be removed safely as a standard action with a DC 20 Heal check.
Otherwise, removing a quill deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.
Material Component: Porcupine quill.
