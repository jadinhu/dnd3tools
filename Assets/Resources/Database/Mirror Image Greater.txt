Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being.
This spell functions like mirror image, except that an additional image is created in each round after the first, up to a maximum of eight concurrent images.
If all images are destroyed, the spell ends.
This spell also differs from mirror image in that you can cast this spell even when it's not your turn.
