You can strike up a pulsing, powerful rhythm that temporarily boosts by 2 the effective caster level of each evil-aligned divine spellcaster within range.
This increase does not grant access to addition al spells, but it does improve all spell effects that are dependent on caster level.
In addition, infernal threnody mimics the effect of an unhallow spell with respect to turning or rebuking undead.
Within the spell's area, each evil-aligned divine spellcaster gains a +4 profane bonus on Charisma checks to rebuke undead, and each good-aligned divine spellcaster takes a -4 profane penalty on Charisma checks to turn undead.
