Similar to the divine spell poison, you inflict a paralyzing poison upon the subject by making a successful melee touch attack.
The poison deals 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage immediately and another 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage 1 minute later.
Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half caster level + caster's Intelligence or Charisma modifier, for wizards and sorcerers, respectively).
Material Component: A poisonous spider, alive or dead.
