When you cast this spell, you extend and sharpen your perceptions for one devastating ranged attack.
Your next single ranged attack (if it is made before the start of your next turn) can be a sneak attack regardless of the distance between you and your target.
This spell doesn't grant you the ability to make a sneak attack if you don't already have that ability.
