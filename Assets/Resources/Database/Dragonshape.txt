You feel a fire burning deep within you.
Crimson scales quickly grow over your body, a pair of great wings sprouts from your shoulders, and your body expands in size until you stand as tall as a house!
You take on the form and abilities of a mature adult red dragon (see below for your new statistics).
You gain 150 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration.
You do not gain the normal spellcasting ability of your new form.
