This spell, whose verbal component is a lively marching song, was commonly used by the elves of Myth Drannor to speed their scouting parties home.
Once the spell is cast, as long as you perform only move actions, you and all allies within 30 feet of you move at a speed 10 feet greater than normal.
In addition, you and your allies may hustle during overland movement for 1 extra hour per day per caster level (see page 164 of the Player's Handbook).
Even with this spell, however, you still suffer the ill effects of forced marching if you attempt to walk for more than 8 hours in a day.
Focus: A small drum.
