You temporarily strengthen the mental bond with your special mount, allowing you and your special mount to predict each other's movements and gain a significant edge in combat.
You and your mount gain a +4 flanking bonus on attack rolls (instead of +2) when the two of you are flanking the same opponent.
Furthermore, your mount gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls for every three paladin levels you possess (maximum +5) for the duration of the spell as long as it remains within the spell's range.
