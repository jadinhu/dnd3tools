Hissing and whispering softly, you lull the targets into a comatose slumber.
Sleeping creatures are helpless.
Slapping or wounding awakens affected creatures, but normal noise does not.
Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).
Hiss of sleep has no effect on creatures that can see you, creatures that have already rolled saving throws against your frightful presence, or unconscious creatures.
