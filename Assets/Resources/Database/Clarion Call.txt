<b>As you defeat an opponent, you shout a battle cry that inspires one of your allies to renew his efforts.</b>
	
You are an inspiring figure on the battlefield. Your personal victories are shared by your allies, allowing them to draw courage and vigor from your actions. 
	
If during your turn a melee attack you make reduces an opponent to fewer than 0 hit points, you can initiate this maneuver. Once it is initiated, all allies within range can immediately either make one melee attack at their highest attack bonus or take a single move action. These allies must be able to see and hear you. These extra attacks are not attacks of opportunity.
