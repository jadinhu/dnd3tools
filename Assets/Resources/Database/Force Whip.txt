This spell creates a whip of magical force that you wield as if you had proficiency with it.
Simply cracking a force whip keeps normal animals (but not magical beasts or vermin) at bay unless they succeed on a Will save.
Affected animals stay at least 30 feet away from you for the duration of the spell, as space permits.
On a successful ranged attack with the whip, any normal animal you strike must succeed on a Will save or become frightened.
Against other creature types, you can use a force whip in combat as if it were a normal whip.
Material Component: A small silk whip.
