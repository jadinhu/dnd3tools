The caster sees through the veil of reality to pose a single question to nameless malevolent entities that exist beyond normal consciousness.
The question must be posed such that the answer is a simple yes or no.
The answer given is correct 75% of the time.
Answers the DM deems too obscure are never revealed.
The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions.
In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM can give a short answer instead (five words or less).
Drug Component:Mordayn vapor.
