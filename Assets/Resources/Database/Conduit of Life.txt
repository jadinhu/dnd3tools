A small kernel of positive energy grows within your heart, warming your whole body.
The next time you use a class feature or racial ability to channel positive energy (such as turn undead or lay on hands), you also heal a number of points of damage to yourself equal to 2d10+1/caster level (maximum 10).
If you are already subject to an ongoing healing effect (such as vigor, or if you receive a cure spell while conduit of life is still in effect, this spell instead heals a number of points of damage equal to 3d8+1/caster level and it is discharged.
