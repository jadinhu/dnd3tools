You create a magical construct called a bloodstar that shoots from your hand and hovers in the air anywhere within the limit of your range (each round, you can move the bloodstar anywhere within range with a standard action spent concentrating on the new position).
The bloodstar pulses with ruby light (providing illumination in a 20-foot radius).
It has hardness 10 and 20 hit points.
Any creature you initially designate within 10 feet of the bloodstar that takes damage from any source must make a saving throw.
On a failed save, the victim takes 1 point of Constitution damage.
Each time a victim or victims are damaged, a new save is allowed.
The blood appears to stream from the wound to the pulsing bloodstar.
Material Component: A ruby worth at least 30 gp.
