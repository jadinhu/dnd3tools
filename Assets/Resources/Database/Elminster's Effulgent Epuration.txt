You create multiple floating silvery spheres, each 6 inches in diameter.
These spheres appear in a spiral above your head or around your body and follow you up to 60 feet per round.
The spheres intercept incoming hostile magic, negating spells or spell-like abilities that would affect you or that have an effect that extends into your space.
One sphere is expended for each spell level of the effect negated, so a slay living spell (Clr 5) would expend five spheres.
In the case of area effect spells, it negates the whole spell.
If not enough spheres exist to negate an incoming effect, the spheres remain and the effect works as normal.
You may move one or more spheres up to 60 feet as a standard action.
If not sent to another area, the spheres default to following you.
If you exceed their range, they remain behind and function normally at that location.
The spheres have no physical substance, do not provide cover or concealment, and conform to narrow spaces up to 6 inches in diameter without altering their ability to function.
They cannot pass through solid objects or force effects.
They cannot be harmed by physical or magical attacks except those that dispel or negate magic entirely (such as dispel magic, antimagic field, and so on).
