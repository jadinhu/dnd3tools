This spell summons a pack of demons from the Infinite Layers of the Abyss to serve you.
	
When the spell is complete, 2d4 dretches (MM 42) appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 babau demons (MM 40) appear. Ten minutes after that, one vrock demon (MM 48) appears. Each creature has maximum hit points per Hit Die. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for
the duration of the spell.
	
The demons obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the demons. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.
