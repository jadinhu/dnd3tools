By laying hands on a creature and saying a brief prayer, you can convince a higher power to grant a second chance to one of your allies.
The target of resurgence can make a second attempt to save against an ongoing spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, such as dominate person, a chaos beast's corporeal instability, or the sickening effect (but not the damage) from unholy blight.
If the target of resurgence is subject to more than one ongoing magic effect, the target chooses one of them to retry the save against.
If the subject succeeds at the saving throw on the second attempt, the effect ends immediately.
Resurgence never restores hit points or ability score damage, but it does eliminate any conditions such as shaken, fatigued, or nauseated that were caused by the spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability.
If a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability doesn't allow a save (such as power word stun), then resurgence won't help the subject recover.
