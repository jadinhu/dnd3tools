As with passwall, you create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials.
If the wall's thickness is more than 1 foot per caster level, then a single excavate spell simply makes a niche or short tunnel with the stated dimensions.
Several excavate spells can be used in succession to breach very thick walls by forming a continuing passage.
Unlike passwall, excavate is an instantaneous effect that does not end and cannot be dispelled; any passage it creates is permanent.
Material Component: A pinch of excavated earth.
