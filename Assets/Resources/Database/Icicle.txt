You create icicles on a ceiling, doorway, or similar overhang.
The icicles fall when a creature walks beneath them, dealing 4d6 points of piercing damage.
Anyone directly under the area takes this damage with no saving throw.
Others within 5 feet of the icicles take half damage, or none if they succeed on a Reflex saving throw.
The caster and any characters you choose can walk under the icicles or through the doorway without triggering the ice attack.
Likewise, you can remove the icicles whenever desired.
Others can remove them with a successful dispel magic or 10 points of fire damage.
However, an unsuccessful attempt to dispel or melt the icicles automatically triggers the attack.
