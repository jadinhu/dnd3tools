The buildings and other structures of the city attack your enemies.
Every round on your turn, every enemy within the spell's area is subject to one melee attack as if from a Gargantuan animated object (slam +15 melee, 2d8+10 damage).
The animated city's attacks disregard cover and concealment (even invisibility is useless).
In addition, all enemies within the area of the spell move at half normal speed (regardless of their mode of movement).
Damage dealt to the animated city structures has no effect.
You may cast this spell only when within a community at least as large as a small city (see page 137 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
