You create an immobile barrier of force that glows as though with moonlight.
You can form the barrier either as a circular shield 5 feet in diameter and 10 feet high around a willing creature, or as a flat, 10-foot-square plane placed either horizontally (across a doorway, for example) or vertically (covering a pit or trap door), as long as it is anchored along at least one edge.
The barrier has an inside and an outside.
From the inside, it is transparent and passable; any creature can move through it.
From the outside, it is opaque and virtually impassable � ;no creature or attack can pass through from this direction.
Creatures inside the moonweb have cover and total concealment against attacks that originate on the outside.
