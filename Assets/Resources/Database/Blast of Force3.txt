You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A blast of force deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). In addition, a successful hit forces the subject to make a Fortitude save or be knocked prone (size and stability modifiers apply to the saving throw as if the spell were a bull rush).
