Immediately upon completion of this spell, the temperature drops to below freezing and a powerful blizzard erupts in the area.
Visibility is reduced to zero, making Spot, Search, and Listen checks and all ranged attacks impossible.
Unprotected flames are automatically extinguished and protected flames have a 75% chance of being doused.
Creatures unprotected from the cold must make a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage.
One foot of new snow falls each round.
Movement within the area is impeded, depending on the creature's size and depth of snow (for movement in a snow field, see page 12).
