<b>You cast this spell upon yourself, and your flesh glows yellow. The glow quickly subsides, but you feel your flesh thicken, its surface growing harder and more like a carapace.</b>
	
The spell grants the recipient a +1 enhancement bonus to its existing natural armor bonus, a +1 racial bonus on saves against poison, and a +1 racial bonus on Hide checks for every three caster levels you have. This means that the bonuses to natural armor, saves, and Hide checks improve to +2 at caster level 6th, +3 at caster level 9th, +4 at 12th, and +5 at 15th.
	
The enhancement bonus provided by spiderskin stacks with the subject's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0.
