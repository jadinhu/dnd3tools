You can briefly grant bardic abilities to a creature of your choice.
	
The subject of the spell can then function as a bard of half your current bard level with respect to bardic music and bardic knowledge.
	
However, Protege imparts no spellcasting ability and does not grant access to spells not normally available to the subject.
	
For Perform checks and bardic music prerequisites, the creature uses its own ranks in Perform or half of yours, whichever is better.
	
Focus: The caster's instrument.
