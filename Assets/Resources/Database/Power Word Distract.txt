A single word from your lips renders your foe vulnerable and distracted.
You utter a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of your choice to become briefly distracted, whether the creature can hear the word or not.
The creature is treated as flat-footed until its next turn.
Any creature that currently has 151 or more hit points is unaffected by power word distract.
