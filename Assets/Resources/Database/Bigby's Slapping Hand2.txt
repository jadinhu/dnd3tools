Bigby's slapping hand causes a magical hand to appear, deliver a slap to one creature, then disappear.
The slap distracts the subject, causing it to immediately provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures threatening its square.
The spell allows no saving throw, but the slapped creature can negate the effect with a successful DC 20 Concentration check.
Focus: A leather glove.
