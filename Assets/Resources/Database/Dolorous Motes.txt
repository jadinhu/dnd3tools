This spell creates flickering motes of light that cause intense mental anguish.
Creatures inside or passing through a cloud of dolorous motes must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round.
A new save may be made each round.
Leaving and then re-entering a cloud of motes forces a new save.
The caster can create one large cloud of flickering motes or several smaller clouds.
For example, a 5th-level caster could create five separate clouds, each filling a 10-foot cube anywhere within the spell's range.
Conversely, the caster can group one or more 10-foot-cubes together to form larger clouds or barriers.
The affected cubes need not be adjacent to one another, but each cloud is stationary once placed.
Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Wisdom damage.
