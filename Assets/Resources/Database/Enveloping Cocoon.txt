A cocoon of shimmering blue-green energy encloses a creature of size Large or smaller, containing it for the spell's duration or until it's destroyed.
The cocoon has hardness 10 and 10 hit points per caster level.
The enveloping cocoon prevents the creature trapped inside from moving or casting spells with somatic components.
The cocoon is too confining to permit effective attacks with anything larger than a natural or light weapon (and the creature inside can attack only the cocoon in any event).
The caster of an enveloping cocoon can attach a second spell to the cocoon by casting it at the cocoon.
When the enveloping cocoon spell ends or is dismissed, the attached spell automatically affects the creature inside, with no save allowed (although spell resistance, if any, still applies).
If the cocoon is destroyed before it is dismissed or the spell duration ends, the attached spell is wasted.
Any of the following spells can be attached to an enveloping cocoon: baleful polymorph, blight, contagion,
dominate animal, flame strike, infestation of maggots, languor, miasma, phantasmal disorientation, poison (the target fails the initial save but gets to attempt the second save).
Material Component: A live caterpillar.
