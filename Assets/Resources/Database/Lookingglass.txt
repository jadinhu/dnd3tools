When you cast this spell, you create one end of a path between two natural mirrored surfaces, such as pools of water or clear lakes.
If you cast a second lookingglass spell on a similar surface before the duration of the first expires, you can look through it as if you were using clairvoyance.
Within 1 minute/level of casting the second lookingglass,
you and up to one other creature/level may step through as if affected by teleport without error.
This spell doesn't provide any ability to survive in the location of either lookingglass, so if you cast it the first spell on a lake, your allies had better be able to swim.
If the spell duration of the first lookingglass spell elapses before you can complete the path with a second casting, the first spell is useless.
