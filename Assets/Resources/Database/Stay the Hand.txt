Your words invoke compassion and mercy in the merciless.
If the target creature fails its save against stay the hand, it refrains from attacking you or targeting you with spells for the remainder of the current round.
You can cast this spell during an opponent's turn after the opponent announces its intention to attack you or target you with a spell.
If the opponent becomes subject to this spell, it can choose a new target to attack, but it takes a -4 circumstance penalty on its attack roll due to the sudden change of intentions at the last second.
Likewise, the subject of this spell can redirect a spell that had been targeted on you, but it must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the spell's level) or the spell is wasted.
