<b>You draw arcane power into your body, wrapping your feet and legs with wisps of flame.</b>
	
You gain the ability to step into fires and move from one fire to another. The fires you enter and move between must be at least as big around as you are. Fire elementals and other fire creatures are not considered &quot;fires&quot; for the purpose of this spell, nor are sources of great heat, such as pools of lava.
	
Once in a fire, you can instantly know the locations of all suitable fires within long range (400 ft. + 40 ft/level) and can transport yourself to one of them. Each transport counts as a full-round action. With each casting of the spell, you can transport yourself once per caster level. If a fire's location doesn't offer enough space for you (for example, a fire contained inside a furnace too small to hold you or a fire already occupied by a big cauldron), it is not a viable destination and you don't sense its location. If a fire rests on a surface that can't support you, it is still a viable destination and you suffer the appropriate consequences if you transport yourself to it. For example, if you transport yourself into a fire burning in a pit full of oil, you fall into the oil when you arrive there.
	
<b>Fire stride</b> provides no protection against fire, so it is advisable to obtain such protection before using the spell.
