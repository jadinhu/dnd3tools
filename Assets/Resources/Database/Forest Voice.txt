You touch the leaves and speak, and your comrade answers you through the plant.
Upon casting this spell, you can touch a normal, Medium or larger plant or tree and designate another of the same kind.
You can then carry on a conversation with anyone who is within 10 feet of the destination plant.
Your conversation is as clear as it would be if you stood within 10 feet of one another.
The plants cannot, however, transmit magical sonic effects.
Both plants must be alive to allow use of this spell.
You can either select a particular destination plant that is already familiar to you, or designate direction and distance and let the forest voice find the appropriate type of plant nearest to the desired location.
