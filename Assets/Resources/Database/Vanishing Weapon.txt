This spell encapsulates a weapon in a faint blue glow.
In addition to dealing normal damage, the weapon dispels on contact any summoned creature or quasireal creature brought into being by a Conjuration (summoning) or Illusion (shadow) spell.
This requires a successful dispel check (1d20 + caster's level) against DC 11 + the level of the caster who summoned or created the creature.
If the vanishing weapon is a ranged weapon, the spell's effect is imparted to the weapon's ammunition.
A summoned or quasi-real creature goaded into touching the vanishing weapon is also dispelled.
This spell has no effect on called creatures.
