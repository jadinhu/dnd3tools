The vital spots on your foe seem to call out to you, guiding your weapon of their own accord.
You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the actions and physiology of your foes.
Your next attack (if it is made before the end of your next turn) is considered a death attack, without the need for the standard 3 rounds of observation.
All other rules for a death attack, such as determining success and damage dealt, apply as normal.
If you don't have the ability to deliver a death attack, this spell has no effect.
