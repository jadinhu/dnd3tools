The caster summons a mass of spores that fill the area around him.
The spores deal 1d8 points of damage to all creatures within 5 feet other than the caster.
Then they penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d2 points of damage each round for 10 rounds.
At the end of this time, a tangle of viny growths covers each subject.
A delay poison spell stops the spores' growth for its duration.
Bless, neutralize poison, or remove disease kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.
Arcane Material Component: The feathers of an avian creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 (a harpy, achaierai, or similar creature).
