As you spin around, you produce residual images of yourself, each of which splits off from your body and moves away.
One or more illusory doubles of you appear, spinning off from your original location as you turn in a circle.
You create one double plus one for every four caster levels you have (minimum one, maximum five).
You are then free to go elsewhere while your doublesmove away in a manner of your choosing.
The doubles move at your speed and can emit minor sounds such as footsteps or metal clanking, but they can only be made to move, withdraw, or run.
Any successful attack against an illusory double destroys it.
A double's Armor Class is equal to 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier.
Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking as though they are burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).
