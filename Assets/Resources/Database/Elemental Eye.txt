You close your eyes, and instantly the area around the chosen object comes into focus.
You enspell a small object to serve as a magic sensor, much like that created by clairaudience/clairvoyance.
Once you have touched the object and cast the spell, you have up to 1 hour/level to activate the magic, thus enabling you to plant the object in a location and then move to a different spot to spy on that location.
Once you have activated the magic � ;that is, once you begin actually using the magic sensor to see � ;the spell lasts for 1 minute/level, or until you choose to end it.
This spell otherwise functions as clairvoyance.
If the object is moved, your sight moves with it, but the spell ends if the stone passes out of range.
Focus: Depending on your chosen element, you must use one of the following as a focus: a stone (earth), a lump of charcoal (fire), a piece of metal (metal), a puddle of water (water), or a chunk of wood (wood).
In each case, the object must weigh between 1/2 and 1 pound.
The focus is also the target of the spell.
