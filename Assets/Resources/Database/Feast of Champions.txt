You bring forth a magnificent feast, including a grand table, chairs, service, and food and drink. 
	
The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. 
	
Every creature partaking of the feast is cured of all diseases, sickness, nausea, fatigue, and exhaustion. Any poison affecting a creature is neutralized, and creatures sharing the feast become immune to poison for 12 hours. The nectarlike beverage that is part of the feast cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20) and grants 1d8 temporary hit points + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). The food of the feast grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws, and immunity to fear effects for 12 hours.
	
If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects are negated.
