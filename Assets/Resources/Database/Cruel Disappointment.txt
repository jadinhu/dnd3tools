The next time the subject of this spell attempts an action that requires a die roll to determine success, the action fails.
However, the spell creates the phantasmal image in the subject's mind that the action succeeded.
The subject behaves accordingly for 1 round.
During the next round, the phantasm fades and the subject now realizes that he was fooled.
If the subject fails a second Will save, he then takes a -4 morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks for 1d6+1 rounds afterward.
