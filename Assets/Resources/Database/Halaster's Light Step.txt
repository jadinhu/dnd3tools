<b>Halaster's Light Step</b>(City of Splendors: Waterdeep)

Transmutation

<b>Components:</b>

 	
As fly, except Halaster's light step provides a maximum speed of 30 feet (20 feet if the subject wears medium or heavy armor).
Additionally, the subject cannot ascend or descend vertically unless hovering 1 foot or less above terrain that ascends or descends at an angle of less than 45 degrees.
The practical impact of this spell is to allow the recipient to walk along reasonably level terrain without leaving tracks and to stride across chasms at will.
It also adds a +15 circumstance bonus on Climb checks, a +10 circumstance bonus on Move Silently checks (which does not stack with the bonus provided by boots of elvenkind), and negates any chance of falling.
When this spell is used in combination with levitate, the combined effect is equivalent to a slow-speed fly spell.
It provides no additional benefit if used in combination with fly.
