A wreath of crackling energy encircles your body, twisting madly around you before sinking into your skin in an unsettling fashion.
This spell infuses your body with energy drawn from the primal forces of chaos.
You gain a +5 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks, as well on grapple checks to resist or escape a grapple.
Your natural weapons are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Regardless of your normal alignment, you are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of effects that rely on alignment (such as protection from chaos or chaos hammer).
If soul of anarchy and soul of light are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/evil or lawful.
If soul of anarchy and soul of shadow are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/good or lawful.
Soul of anarchy counters and dispels soul of order, and vice versa.
Special: A chaotic-aligned dragon capable of casting 4th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
