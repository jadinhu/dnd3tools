 <b>Effect:</b> Protective star of energy
 <b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)

 	
You create a glowing mote of energy that stays near your shoulder, providing light equal to that of a candle.
This star has the following three functions, and you can designate which function to activate as a free action on your turn.
Spell Turning: The holy star can turn a total of four to seven (1d4+3) spell levels as the spell turning spell.
Any turning potential depleted through this use remains so for the duration of the spell; the holy star does not return to full capacity every time you choose this function.
If its entire spell turning capacity is expended, this function no longer works, but the others do.
Protection: The holy star gives you a +10 circumstance bonus to AC without affecting your actions.
Fire Bolt: The holy star lashes out with a beam of energy as a ranged touch attack against a creature up to 90 feet away.
This attack uses your attack bonus and deals fire damage equal to 1d6 points per two caster levels (maximum 10d6).
