You create an unmoving, transparent sphere of force centered on your location.
The sphere illuminates its interior and everything within 5 feet of its edge.
You and your allies may enter the sphere at will.
Any other creature that tries to enter the sphere must make a Will saving throw, otherwise it cannot pass into the area defined by the sphere.
A creature may leave the area freely, although it must make a Will save to enter again, even if the creature is you or one of your allies.
Creatures within the area when the spell is cast are not forced out.
The forceward does not prevent spells or objects from entering the forceward, so it is possible for two creatures on opposite sides of the forceward's edge to fight without penalties (although creatures using unarmed attacks or natural weapons still have tomake Will saves every round for their attacks to have a chance of entering the forceward).
