<b>You use your foe?s momentum against him, throwing him through the air to crash into a second enemy.</b>
	
This maneuver functions like mighty throw (page 73), except as noted here.
	
As part of this maneuver, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against your foe. You can then make a trip attempt against your enemy. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check.
	
If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him up to 10 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. You select your enemy?s destination square. The target falls prone in that space and takes 4d6 points of damage. For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw range. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 20 feet of you. You can throw your opponent into a space occupied by a second foe. In this case, the opponent in the target square also takes 4d6 points of damage and is knocked prone. A Reflex save (DC 14 + your Str modifier) halves this damage and allows the second target to remain standing. The thrown creature then falls prone in a clear space of your choice adjacent to the second target.</
