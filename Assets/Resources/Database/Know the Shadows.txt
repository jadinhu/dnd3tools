You bend surrounding shadows and blend them to yourself, making yourself one with the darkness.
As long as you remain within 10 feet of some kind of shadow (except your own shadow) or within at least moderate darkness, your ability to hide is greatly enhanced.
You can hide yourself from view in the open without anything to hide behind, even while being observed, and you gain a +20 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.
Unlike invisibility, this spell's effects do not end when you attack, though you cannot hide and attack at the same time.
You are clearly visible while attacking (and thus do not gain a +2 bonus on your attack for being invisible, nor is your target denied its Dexterity bonus to AC), but you can use a move-equivalent action to hide again after attacking (or hide as part of a move action), and you still gain the +20 circumstance bonus on your Hide check.
Your opponent can ready an action to attack you when you come into view to attack.
