This spell unleashes a blinding flash of sunlight originating with you and expanding outward.
Any creature within the area of the spell that can see you must make a saving throw or be temporarily blinded.
The blindness lasts for 1 minute per caster level.
An undead creature caught within the spell area takes 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), or half damage if a Reflex save is successful.
In addition, the beam results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light (such as a vampire) if it fails its save.
The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.
