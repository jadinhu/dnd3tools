<b>Small orbs of light circle your head. With a gesture, you cause one to spin off and strike your friend, healing him of damage.</b>
	
You create ten gently pulsing darts of pale blue light that orbit your head like ioun stones. As a free action, you can launch one dart per round at an ally you designate within range. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can launch up to three darts per round at one or more designated allies within range. As a full-round action, you can launch all remaining orbs at one or more allies within range.
	
Each dart heals 1d8 points of damage the target has taken, as though it were a cure spell.
Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell damages them instead of curing their wounds.
An undead creature can apply spell resistance to this effect, and you must make a successful ranged touch attack for each dart you attempt to launch against such a creature.
