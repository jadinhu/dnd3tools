<b>Your quick movements and rapid utterances release the spell's energy, culminating in a final cry that unleashes a tremendous bolt of sonic energy from your open hand.</b>
	
The bolt of sonic energy deals 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to each creature within its area. In addition, a resonating bolt deals full damage to objects and can easily shatter or break interposing barriers. If the bolt destroys a barrier, it can continue beyond the barrier if its range permits; otherwise, it stops.
