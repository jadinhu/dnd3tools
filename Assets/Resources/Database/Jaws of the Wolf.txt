You turn small wooden carvings into wolves (one for every two caster levels) that appear between you and your opponents.
The wolves act on their own but obey your mental commands.
The wolves are normal in all respects except that they have spell resistance 13 and the special ability of frightful presence (see the Monster Manual).
At the end of the spell, the wolves become carvings again.
Focus:One carving of a wolf for each that you create.
