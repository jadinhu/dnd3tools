Upon casting this spell, you must choose one disease from this list: blinding sickness, cackle fever, filth fever, mindfire, red ache, the shakes, or slimy doom (see Disease, page 292 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, for descriptions).
Any living creature you hit with a melee touch attack during the spell's duration is affected as though by the contagion spell, immediately contracting the disease you have selected unless it makes a successful Fortitude save.
You cannot infect more than one creature per round.
