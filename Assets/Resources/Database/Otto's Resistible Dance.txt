You can play a tune so foot-tappingly appealing that everyone who hears it wants to jump up and dance.
In fact, unless your target makes a successful Will save to resist, that's exactly what happens.
A dancing creature suffers a -2 circumstance penalty to its Armor Class, Will saves, Concentration checks, and Spellcraft checks for as long as you keep playing.
Focus: The caster's instrument.
