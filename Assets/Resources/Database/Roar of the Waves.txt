The ocean's voice is a terrible and majestic thing.
Bards understand the power of the ocean's song and have harnessed that in this spell.
The targets of this spell are suddenly bombarded by the sound of the roaring ocean.
The target is deafened for the duration of the spell.
Additionally, each target must make a Will save or be shaken.
This sound can be heard by anyone within 30 feet of the targets, but only those actually targeted are affected.
Material Component: Pieces of shell that have been battered by the surf.
