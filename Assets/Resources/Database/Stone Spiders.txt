You transform 1d3 pebbles into stone constructs that resemble monstrous spiders.
The constructs can be any size from Tiny to Huge as you decide, but all the constructs you create must be the same size.
The constructs have the same statistics as monstrous spiders (see Appendix 2 in the Monster Manual) of the appropriate size, except as follows: Their natural armor increases by +6.
They have damage reduction 30/+2.
Their poison has a Fortitude save DC of 17 + your Wisdom modifier.
Initial and secondary damage is 1d3 points of temporary Strength damage.
If the constructs can hear your commands, you can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
Otherwise, they simply attack your enemies to the best of their abilities.
Alternatively, you can cast stone spiders on 1d3 vermin of any type or size.
The affected vermin gain the benefits of a stoneskin spell (damage reduction 10/+5) for 1 round per caster level.
