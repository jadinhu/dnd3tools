This spell lowers the subject's damage reduction value by 5/+1.
Thus, if you successfully cast vulnerability on a dragon with damage reduction 15/+2, its damage reduction becomes 10/+1.
For every three caster levels beyond 11th, the damage reduction decreases by an additional 5/+1: 10/+2 at 14th, 15/+3 at 17th, and 20/+4 at 20th.
