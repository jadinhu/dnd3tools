Immense, scaled wings unfurl from behind you and beat at nearby foes in a savage flurry before vanishing as quickly as they appeared.
You evoke flickering dragon's wings that strike at every target in range, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level to all designated targets within 30 feet that fail a Reflex saving throw and half that damage to creatures that succeed on the save.
Creatures that fail the Reflex save are also dazed for 1 round.
Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, casts this spell at +1 caster level.
