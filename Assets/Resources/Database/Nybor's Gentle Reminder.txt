This spell was quite popular with slave overseers and those wishing to make their servants work a little faster.
The Red Wizards now employ it mainly as a combat spell.
The subject receives a sharp, agonizing pain, which makes him dazed (no actions, but can defend against attacks normally) for 1 round.
The subject suffers a -1 penalty on attacks, saving throws, and most checks while the spell lasts; however, the subject also receives a +2 circumstance bonus to Strength.
Focus: A stick at least 1 foot long.
