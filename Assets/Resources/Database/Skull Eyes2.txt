Each creature within range that can see you must attempt a Will saving throw every round at the beginning of its turn to avoid the effect.
In addition, you can actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range.
Depending on the foe's Hit Dice, the gaze attack may have either of two effects, as follows.
While this spell is in effect, your eyes are black and have skull-shaped irises.
