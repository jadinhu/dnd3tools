This spell causes a small but extremely loud bee to appear.
It buzzes around the head of a creature you designate.
(The creature must be within range, and you must be touching or be able to see the creature.
Once you designate a creature, the bee stays with it; you cannot designate another creature).
The bee creates an unnerving noise that disrupts the subject's concentration.
The subject takes a -10 penalty on all Move Silently and Concentration checks.
(Creatures that can't hear don't take the penalty on Concentration checks).
If the subject attempts to cast or maintain a spell, it must make a DC 10 Concentration check even if there are no other distractions.
The bee has a fly speed of 180 feet (perfect).
It remains near the subject in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, cover, concealment, or any other attempt at disguising or hiding.
The bee remains until the spell's duration expires or the subject moves out of range.
The bee can't be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
Material Component: A dab of honey.
