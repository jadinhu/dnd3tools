This demon-inspired transmutation causes the subject to secrete a slimy red layer of jelly that coats its skin, armor, and equipment. A creature that strikes a slime-protected subject with an unarmed strike, a touch attack (including a touch spell), or a natural weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage. Any creature in a grapple with the target of babau slime takes 1d8 points of acid damage at the beginning of its turn.
