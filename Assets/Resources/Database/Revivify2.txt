<b>The diamonds vaporize from your hand as you cast this spell, and the vapors they give off wrap around your fallen companion, dragging her soul back into her mortal form.</b>
	
Revivify miraculously restores life to a recently deceased creature. However, the spell must be cast within 1 round of the victim's death. Before the soul of the deceased has completely left the body, this spell halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the body. This spell functions like <b>raise dead</b> (PH 268), except that the raised creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of spells. The creature has -1 hit points (but is stable).
	
Material Component: Diamonds worth at least 1,000 gp.
