As stone shape, except as noted above and that you affect metal instead of stone.
You may employ this spell in combat with a successful melee touch attack.
Shape metal successfully used in this way against a target's armor reduces the armor's protection by 1d6 points of Armor Class (armor such as studded leather that mostly made of nonmetal materials take half damage from this spell).
If used against a shield, weapon, or metallic creature, the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels, bypassing the target's hardness (or damage reduction in the case of a creature).
Touching an unwilling creature or an item held by an unwilling creature requires a melee touch attack and provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender.
You may ready an action to touch a creature, its armor, its shield, or its weapon when it attempts to strike you; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity (you are using the creature's movement to come into contact with it).
Arcane Material Component: A piece of wire, bent approximately into the desired shape and touched to the metal while the verbal component is uttered.
