Using nonverbal means, you can communicate a simple message to one other intelligent creature within range.
By simply waving a hand, placing a scroll on a table, raising an eyebrow, or making any other sign, the spell allows the target to understand any complete thought of twenty-five words or less, so long as you and the target could normally communicate.
You can't send a verbal message if you don't speak the target's language, but can transmit a simple emotional appeal (such as &quot;help&quot; or &quot;danger&quot;) that the recipient knows is from you.
You can use this spell even if you are bound and gagged, so long as the focus is on your person.
Focus: A small glass cone.
