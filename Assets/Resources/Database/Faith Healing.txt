When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (up to +5).
The spell only works on a creature with the same patron as you.
A target with no patron or a different patron than you is unaffected by the spell, even if the target would normally be harmed by positive energy.
