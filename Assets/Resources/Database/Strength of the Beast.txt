This spell functions only if you are a lycanthrope, and it benefits you only while you are in your humanoid form.
While under the effect of this spell, you gain certain characteristics of your animal form while remaining in humanoid form.
You gain the same damage reduction you have in animal form (normally 5/silver or 10/silver), the scent special quality, and the feats you have access to in animal form.
In addition, you gain one-half the adjustment for each ability score that you gain in animal form, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 2.
For example, if you are a werebear, you gain Str +8 (half of your animal form's +16) and Con +4 (half of +8), but no adjustment to your Dexterity because half of +2, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 2, is +0.
If you must make a Control Shape check while under the effect of this spell, you take a -4 penalty on your check.
Focus: A lock of hair from your animal form.
