<b>Rushing to the body of your fallen ally, you call out magic words that will bring back life and breath to your friend.</b>
	
Last breath restores life to a recently deceased creature, creating a new body for the returning spirit to inhabit. However, the spell must be cast within 1 round of the victim's death. This spell functions like <b>reincarnate</b> (PH 270), except that the reincarnated creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of spells. The creature has -1 hit points (but is stable).
	
Material Component: Rare oils and unguents worth a total of at least 500 gp, spread over the remains.
