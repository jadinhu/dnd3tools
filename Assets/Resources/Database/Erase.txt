Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces.
With this spell, you can remove explosive runes, a glyph of warding, a sepia snake sigil, or an arcane mark, but not illusory script or a symbol spell.
Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it.
Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.
Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15.
(A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check).
If you fail to erase explosive runes, a glyph of warding, or a sepia snake sigil, you accidentally activate that writing instead.
