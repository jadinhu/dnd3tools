<b>You sweep your arms as if to push aside a branch and simultaneously call out for the plants around you to move aside. Obediently, the plants surrounding you oblige.</b>
	
Anyone in the area of the spell (including you) finds the undergrowth held aside while they pass. This effect essentially provides a trail through any kind of undergrowth, and you treat any trackless terrain as having a trail (<b>PH</b> 164). Once the effect of the spell passes, the plants return to their normal shape. The DC to track anyone who traveled within the area of this spell increases by 5 (the equivalent of hiding the trail).
	
This spell has no effect on plant creatures (that is, they aren't pushed or held aside by its effect).
