A shimmering crown of force appears upon the recipient's head.
A barely visible shield of force projects forward from it, warding off attacks aimed at its wearer.
This spell creates a crown of magical energy that grants the spell's recipient a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on all saves.
As an immediate action, the creature wearing a crown of protection can discharge its magic to gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC or a +4 resistance bonus on saves for 1 round.
The spell ends after the wearer uses the crown in this manner.
The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm.
If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.
Focus: An iron hoop 6 inches in diameter.
