This spell causes creatures it hits to become weak and slow.
A subject who fails a Will save is slowed as the spell and suffers a cumulative enhancement penalty to Strength equal to 1d6-1 per two caster levels (minimum additional penalty of 0, maximum of -10) each round.
If the subject's Strength drops below 1, it is helpless.
This spell does not counter haste nor it is countered by it, but a hasted creature can be brought to normal speed by languor, and a creature affected by languor can be brought to normal speed by haste.
