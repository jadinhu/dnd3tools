You feel the mighty force of elemental wyrms flood your spirit and reinforce your body. Your flesh hardens, and your eyes gleam.
	
Few creatures represent both themystic and the elemental more than dragons. You tap into the spiritual might of these magnificent creatures to gain a breath weapon and a defensive ability based on your favored element (and the dragon variety channeled by the spell). See the table below for details.
	
The breath weapon takes the form of a 15-foot cone-shaped burst. Using the breath weapon requires a standard action, and each time you breathe, you must wait 1d4 rounds before breathing again. Spell resistance does not apply against the breath weapon's effect.
