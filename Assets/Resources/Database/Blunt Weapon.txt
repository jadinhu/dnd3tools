Blunt weapon reduces the effectiveness of certain weapons by rendering them semisubstantial.
Affected weapons appear shimmery or shadowy when examined closely, but the wielder must specifically examine the weapon (a move-equivalent action) to notice the effect.
An affected weapon retains its full enhancement bonus and magical abilities (if any), but its base damage is reduced by half.
The strength bonus of the wielder still applies normally to attacks and damage.
A weapon carried by a creature uses that creature's Fortitude saving throw.
A magic weapon gets a bonus equal to its enhancement bonus on this save.
Only manufactured piercing and slashing weapons are affected by blunt weapon.
It has no effect on natural weapons.
Arrows and other projectile weapons affected by the spell remain blunted even after they leave the spell's area.
