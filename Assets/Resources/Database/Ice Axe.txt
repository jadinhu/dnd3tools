This spell creates a battleaxe-shaped formation of jagged, fast-swirling ice shards in your hand. You are automatically considered proficient with the <b>ice axe</b>. Attacks with the <b>ice axe</b> are melee touch attacks. The axe deals 2d12 points of cold damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) with a successful hit. You cannot be disarmed of the <b>ice axe</b> nor can it be sundered. Since the axe is virtually weightless, your Strength modifier does not apply on damage rolls. If your base attack bonus is high enough to allow for multiple attacks in a round, you can make them with the <b>ice axe</b>.
	
If you choose to hold something other than the <b>ice axe</b> in your hand or use the hand in some other way, the <b>ice axe</b> vanishes until the hand is empty again.
	
Material Component: A shard of ice, glass, or crystal.
