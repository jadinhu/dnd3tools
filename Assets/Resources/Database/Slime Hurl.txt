You conjure and hurl three roughly spherical globs of dark green slime.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target with a slime glob (roll separately for each glob, using your best ranged attack bonus).
Any creature struck by a glob is coated in a patch of green slime (see Dungeon Master's Guide page 76) and begins to experience its effects immediately.
You can hit a creature with multiple globs, each of which must be dealt with separately.
The conjured green slime does not disappear automatically and must be destroyed in the normal way.
