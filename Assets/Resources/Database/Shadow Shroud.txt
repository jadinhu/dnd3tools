A thin membrane of darkness coats your body.
This spell negates any penalties or other harmful effects imposed by your light blindness or light vulnerability.
You also gain a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks made in areas of shadow or darkness.
As with any darkness spell, the effect is suppressed if you enter the area of a light spell of 3rd level or higher.
