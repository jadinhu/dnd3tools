You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane.
Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes.
You can only cast this spell while you are on the Ethereal Plane.
When you cast the spell, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane.
At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1 foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter.
You determine the environment within the demiplane when you first cast genesis, reflecting most any desire you can visualize.
You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain.
This spell cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth).
You must add these things in some other fashion if you desire.
Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, you can continue to cast this spell to enlarge your demiplane, adding another 180 feet of radius to your demiplane each time.
Material Component: A crystalline sphere; XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
