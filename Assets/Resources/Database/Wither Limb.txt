The caster chooses to wither either the arms or the legs of the subject.
Withered legs force a character to fall prone and make it impossible for her to move more than 5 feet per round.
Withered arms make it impossible for a character to use objects or cast spells with somatic components, and the subject must drop anything she was holding.
At the end of the spell's duration, the limbs return to normal.
