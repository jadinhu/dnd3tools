Your eyes become wintry tombs that destroy the spark of life in those who you meet your stare.
Each round you may target a single living creature.
It must make a Will saving throw or be frozen in place.
Frozen creatures cannot move, attack, cast spells, or defend themselves; they are considered immobile, losing shield and Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class and taking a further -4 penalty to Armor Class.
Frozen creatures are entitled to an additional saving throw if attacked, but this provides no immunity to the gaze.
A creature that has been immobilizing with a freezing glance,
then restored to motion after an attack, can still be the target of the same freezing glance in a later round.
Though the gaze attack ends rather quickly, frozen creatures remain immobile for 1 minute per level.
In some cases, this can cause serious damage through exposure to the elements.
