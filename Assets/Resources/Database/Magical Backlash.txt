With a word and a gesture, the target flares with crackling, violet-colored energy.
Magical backlash causes any spells affecting the target to resonate painfully.
For each spell currently in effect on the target (not counting magical backlash itself), magical backlash deals 2 points of damage per level of that spell.
For example, a creature targeted by magical backlash that is under the effects of bull's strength, blur, and mage armor spells would take 4 points of damage for bull's strength, 4 for blur, and 2 more for mage armor for a total of 10 points of damage.
