You touch a recently slain ally and temporarily restore her to life so she may continue to fight.
The target can have been dead for up to 1 round/caster level.
She functions as if a raise dead spell had been cast upon her, except that she does not lose a level and has half of her full normal hit points.
She is alive (not undead) for the duration of the spell and
can be healed normally, but dies as soon as the spell ends.
While the subject is under this spell, she is not affected by resurrection or raise dead.
The target gains a +1 morale bonus on attacks, damage, saves, and checks against the creature that killed her.
