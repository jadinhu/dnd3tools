Depending on the version you choose, the control snow and ice spell raises or lowers ice or snow.
Lower Snow and Ice: This causes snow and ice to sink away to a minimum depth of 1 inch.
The depth can be lowered by up to 2 feet per caster level.
The snow and ice is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level.
In extremely large and deep snow and ice fields, such as a glacier, the spell creates a crevasse that sweeps creatures downward (without dealing damage), rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
They can climb out of a crevasse, as normal with a DC 18 Climb check.
When cast on ice elementals and other ice-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell.
The spell has no effect on other creatures.
Raise Snow and Ice: This causes snow and ice to rise in height, just as the lower snow and ice version causes it to lower.
Creatures and objects on top of the snow or ice are raised along with the top level of snow.
For either version, the character may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.
