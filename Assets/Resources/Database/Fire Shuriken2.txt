This spell creates shuriken formed of magical fire that you can throw like normal shuriken (they do not burn your hands).
You are automatically considered proficient with the fire shuriken.
You create three fire shuriken if you are 1st to 6th level, six if you are 7th to 12th level, and nine if you are 13th level or higher.
You can throw three fire shuriken as a standard action, but all three must target the same creature.
If you create more than three shuriken, you can throw the remaining shuriken on subsequent rounds.
They have a range increment of 10 feet.
A single fire shuriken deals 1 point of normal damage and an additional 1d4 points of fire damage.
If you score a critical hit, the shuriken damage is doubled and the fire damage increases to 1d8.
Do not apply your Strength modifier to the shuriken damage.
If you are making a sneak attack, add the extra damage only to the damage of the first shuriken you throw in a round.
Material Component: A shuriken coated with pine sap and sulfur.
