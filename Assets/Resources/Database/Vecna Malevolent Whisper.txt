You whisper a horrific word of power that rends the soul of your subject.
A weaker (and perhaps older) variant of the power word spells, this horrible malediction was supposedly created by the Whispered One himself, long before his ascension to godhood.
The subject of the spell is reduced to -9 hit points (no roll to check for becoming stable is necessary).
