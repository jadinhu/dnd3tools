You cause a wave of visible force resembling a crashing ocean wave to appear and immediately impact a single target.
If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4+1 hit points of damage and must make an opposed Strength check to avoid a bull rush.
The wave of force has Strength 18, is Medium-size, and is considered charging for the purpose of this check, and always moves the target the maximum distance possible.
If the wave of force fails the opposed Strength check, the target is not moved.
If the target makes its saving throw, it takes 1 hit point of damage and avoids the bull rush attempt.
Focus: A small piece of string and a drop of water.
