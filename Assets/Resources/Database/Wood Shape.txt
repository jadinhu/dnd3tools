Wood shape enables you to form one existing piece of wood into any shape that suits your purpose.
For example, you can make a wooden weapon, fashion a special trapdoor, or sculpt a crude idol.
This spell also permits you to reshape a wood door to make an exit where one didn't exist or to seal a door shut.
While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn't possible.
There is a 30% chance that any shape that includes moving parts simply doesn't work.
