You channel negative energy into the dark mote in your hand, causing it to leap and dart about in your grasp.
When you have poured enough energy into the spell, you release the mote to drain the life of your enemy.
This spell uses negative energy to drain the vitality from a single foe.
The spell's strength depends on the amount of time you spend channeling energy into it.
If you cast channeled lifetheft as a swift action, it renders a single target fatigued, and you gain 5 temporary hit points.
If you cast the spell as a standard action, it renders the target fatigued and deals 5d4 points of damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + the damage dealt.
If you cast channeled lifetheft as a full-round action, it renders the target exhausted and deals 5d4 points of damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to 10 + the damage dealt.
If you spend 2 full rounds casting this spell, it renders the target exhausted and deals 5d8 points of damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to 10 + the damage dealt.
Temporary hit points granted by this spell last for up to 1 hour.
When you begin casting this spell, you decide when you are finished casting it after the appropriate time has passed.
You do not need to declare ahead of time how long you want to spend casting the spell.
