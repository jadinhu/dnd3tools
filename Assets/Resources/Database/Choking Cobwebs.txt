You fill an area with thin, dust-laden choking strands.
This spell covers an area in layers of clinging filaments that resemble old, dusty cobwebs.
Unlike a web spell, the strands of a choking cobwebs spell need not be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points, though they can be.
Unsupported cobwebs flutter in the air as through held up by a rising current.
The cobwebs block sight beyond 5 feet.
A creature within 5 feet has concealment.
Creatures farther away have total concealment.
Entering a square of cobwebs costs 2 squares of movement.
A living creature that enters choking cobwebs falls into a fit of horrific coughing, making it sickened for as long as it remains in the area and for 1 round after it leaves.
A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect, but the save must be repeated each round the creature enters or remains within the area.
If two or more choking cobwebs spells overlap the same area, the overlapping area of the two spells becomes a nearly impenetrable barrier of stands.
In addition to the effects described above, any creature within the overlapping area has cover against adjacent creatures, and total cover against creatures more than 5 feet away.
Entering a square of overlapping cobwebs costs 4 squares of movement, and a living creature within this area is nauseated rather than sickened (Fortitude negates) and also takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage in each round that it is nauseated.
