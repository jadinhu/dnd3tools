You surround yourself with whispers that injure any creature that comes into contact with you.
Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons suffers 1d6 points of sonic damage +1 point per caster level.
If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage.
Weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.
You cannot use this spell to deal damage to another target (for instance, with an unarmed attack or by forcing the whispers against a target).
Only if another creature touches you does the spell deal damage.
