<b>After making a dramatic gesture and uttering a few words of power, you close your eyes and open them again, revealing all that is hidden.</b>
	
All creatures and objects within a zone of revelation are made visible. This includes invisible creatures, as well as those on coexistent planes such as the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 150). Natives of these planes do not lose any abilities but are simply made visible.
	
Zone of revelation suppresses but does not dispel invisibility, etherealness, or other spells. Once a formerly invisible object or creature leaves the area, it becomes invisible again. Ethereal creatures in the spell's area become nonethereal until they move beyond the spell's range.
	
Arcane Material Component: A handful of dust from the grave clothes of an
undead creature.
