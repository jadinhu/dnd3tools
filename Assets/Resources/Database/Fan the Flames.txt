<b>Flickering flame dances across your blade, then springs toward your target as you sweep your sword through the air.</b>
	
A skilled Desert Wind adept can gather flame within his weapon and hurl it through the air. When you initiate this maneuver, you launch a fist-sized ball of white-hot fire at a single opponent. If you make a successful ranged touch attack, your target takes 6d6 points of fire damage.
This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
