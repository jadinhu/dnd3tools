You call up a ghostly fiddle bow in the air above the targeted creature.
This bow immediately descends into the subject's body and begins to saw back and forth against its skeleton.
Although the music produced is eerily beautiful, it causes intense pain and anguish to the victim.
In each round of the duration, the victim takes 1d6 points of sonic damage and has a -20 penalty on all Move Silently checks; the sonic damage is considered to be continuous damage for the purposes of disrupting spellcasting.
As a standard action, you can move the bonefiddle to another creature in range, but the new target gains a saving throw to resist the spell.
If a target ever makes its saving throw, the bonefiddle vanishes and the spell ends.
The spell's effects continue even if the target moves so you no longer have line of sight or line of effect to it, but you cannot shift the bonefiddle to a new target unless you have
both line of sight and line of effect to the current target and to the intended target.
Material Component: A miniature silver fiddle worth at least 30 gp.
