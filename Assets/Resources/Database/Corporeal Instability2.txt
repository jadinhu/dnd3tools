<b>You brush your fingers against the enemy, and immediately his bones begin to soften until he flows down into a flesh-colored puddle.</b>
	
Your touch transforms a living creature into a spongy, amorphous mass, its shape melting and writhing uncontrollably. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet, or one-quarter normal, whichever is less (minimum 5 feet). The victim becomes blinded and cannot cast spells or use magic items, and searing pain renders it incapable of attacking. While in this form, the creature has immunity to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks due to its amorphous nature. A conscious victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a new save in any later round. Success ends the spell effect.
	
Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state, it takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom is reduced to 0, it falls unconscious.
