You descend into a protective bubble in the earth below where you were standing.
Spectators around you see you descend into the ground as if the earth opened up and swallowed you.
You cannot enter the land womb through stone or rock, only through tillable soil.
The land womb holds you secure 10 feet below the surface.
Anyone in a land womb cannot be perceived by divination spells of 4th level or lower.
You may bring one additional creature per caster level with you into the land womb.
All creatures to be brought into the land womb must be touching each other (for instance, in a ring of hands).
You can breathe in the land womb, though the tightness of the space constricts you enough that you cannot cast spells with somatic components.
You can, however, speak to anyone who accompanied you.
You can no longer hear or see anything on the surface via nonmagical means.
You can end the spell at will, but those who are with you cannot.
At the end of the spell's duration, all within the land womb return to the spot where they stood before the spell took effect.
