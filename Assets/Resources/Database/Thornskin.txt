Your skin sprouts thorns when this spell is cast, increasing the damage you deal with an unarmed strike and making you difficult to grab.
As well as dealing lethal damage on an unarmed strike (if you don't already do so), you deal an extra 1d6 points of piercing damage (so that a human under the effect of thornskin would deal 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 points of piercing damage with an unarmed strike).
In addition, any creature that hits you with a natural weapon or unarmed strike (including all successful grapple checks) takes 5 points of piercing damage.
Material Component: A thorn.
