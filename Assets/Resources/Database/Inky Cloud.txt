The inky cloud created by this spell billows out from your location.
The cloud obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).
Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).
A moderate current (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong current (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.
The spell functions only underwater.
Material Component: A small vial containing the ink of a squid or octopus.
