You create a yawning area of roiling purple-red energy resembling a great mouth.
This field of energy has the following effects upon anything that touches or enters it.
First, all creatures except you take 1 point of damage per caster level.
Spell resistance applies to the damage (but not the other effects of the spell).
Those affected by the spell make a Will saving throw every round.
A successful saving throw halves the damage in that round.
Second, the chaotic energy makes it difficult to concentrate.
Any activity that involves concentration (such as casting a spell or using a spell-like ability) requires a Concentration check (DC 25 + spell level) to succeed.
Creatures with the chaotic subtype are unaffected by this spell.
Material Component: A jawbone with teeth.
