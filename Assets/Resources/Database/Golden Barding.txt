You conjure forth a glowing, golden suit of barding for your special mount.
The golden barding you create has no armor check penalty and has no effect on your mount's speed.
The exact nature of the barding depends on your caster level.
2nd-3rd: Scale mail barding (+4 armor bonus).
4th-5th: Chainmail barding (+5 armor bonus).
6th-7th: Splint mail barding (+6 armor bonus).
8th-9th:Half-plate barding (+7 armor bonus).
10th+: Full plate barding (+8 armor bonus).
Because golden barding is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
