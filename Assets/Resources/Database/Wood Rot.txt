When you cast this spell, an insidious rot immediately taints any wooden object or plant creature you touch.
Any unattended nonmagical wooden item smaller than 6 feet in diameter, or a 3-foot-radius volume of a larger wooden object (such as a wooden door), is instantly destroyed by wood rot.
In combat, you can use the spell to attempt to sunder any wooden or wooden-hafted weapon; the weapon or its wooden portion is destroyed on a successful melee touch attack.
Attempting to sunder a weapon generally provokes attacks of opportunity, and wood rot has no effect on wooden or wooden-hafted weapons that strike you, even if you hold the charge.
Against wooden shields or armor, you also make a melee touch attack.
Targets too large to be destroyed outright take a -1d6 penalty to their bonus to Armor Class on a successful hit and are rendered unusable if the penalty exceeds the bonus.
Any attack against a wooden object discharges the spell, and wooden magic items are immune to the effect of wood rot.
Against plant creatures, wood rot deals 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15) on a successful attack.
Against plant creatures only, the spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.
Once it is used to make an attack against a plant creature, wood rot cannot be used to attack or destroy wooden items.
Material Component: A live termite.
