You imbue a creature with an invisible shield that protects it from all effects of sunlight.
If cast on a vampire or other creature that is normally harmed or destroyed by exposure to sunlight, the spell allows that creature to function in sunlight without hindrance.
The spell does not overcome any aversion the target creature may have for sunlight, however.
Night's mantle is not countered or dispelled by any light spell of equal or lower level (such as the 3rd-level cleric spell daylight).
It can be countered or dispelled by a light spell of greater level (such as the 8th-level cleric spell sunburst, which both counters night's mantle and inflicts its normal damage).
Material Component: Powdered ruby (value no less than 1,000 gp).
