Though the creature struggles to contain itself, its breath weapon bursts forth explosively.
The target of the spell is compelled to use its breath weapon as soon as it is capable.
For instance, if a dragon must wait 1d4 rounds, and it rolls a 2, it must use its breath weapon after 2 rounds.
The creature is capable of taking normal actions whenever its breath weapon is not available, though it cannot use any feats or spells that delay this result.
Special: Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 level.
