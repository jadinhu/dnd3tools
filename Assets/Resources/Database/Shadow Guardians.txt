As phantom guardians, except that the figures are partially real.
Each guardian has the statistics noted below (regardless of its actual size or appearance).
In addition to the brief orders given to each new shadow guardian, the caster can give each guardian a simple trigger that causes it to attack, such as &quot;attack anyone approaching within 30 feet&quot; or &quot;attack anyone not wearing these colors&quot;.
The shadow guardians have no special visual acuity � ;
invisibility, disguises, and the like can easily fool them.
The shadow guardians deal normal damage.
Against a creature that recognizes a shadow guardian as an illusion, it deals only 50% normal damage.
