You cause a stone object, with volume of at least 8 cubic feet, to explode.
Rock shards fly outward from the detonation, and all creatures within the area of the spell take 1d4 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +15).
A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
A magic stone object, or a nonmagic stone object in the possession of another creature, gets a Fortitude save to negate the effect.
Creatures cannot be affected by rockburst.
