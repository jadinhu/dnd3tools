You bring into being a mobile, spherical energy field that protects against fire.
All creatures within the area of the spell gain immunity to fire damage.
In addition, the sphere prevents the entrance of any creature with the fire subtype and hedges out such creatures that are in the area when the spell is cast.
You must overcome a creature's spell resistance to keep it at bay.
