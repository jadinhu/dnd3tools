By means of this spell, you wrap yourself in a pulsating nimbus of netherlight ï¿½ ;the mystical aggregate of all your unresolved frustration and rage.
Anyone foolish enough to attack you while this nimbus is
in effect is in for a most unpleasant surprise.
Each time you are the target of an attack, you gain increasingly greater power over your attacker.
First, this spell generates a cumulative +1 bonus to all attack rolls and to damage against that foe each and every time it strikes you, up to a maximum bonus equal to your level.
Second, you gain the ability to overcome any damage reduction your opponent might have, as though you possessed the necessary alignment or weapon materials.
Last but not least, you gain a cumulative dam age reduction of your own, equal to 1/- each time your opponent strikes you, up to a maximum benefit of DR 15/-.
If you are fighting multiple opponents, you must keep track of how many times each one has struck you in order to determine the benefits this spell grants you against each.
A mantle of pure spite provides its benefits even at range, so a wizard launching harmful spells at you from what she thinks is a safe distance will still kindle the mantle of pure spite's nimbus and experience its spiteful reprisals.
Material Component: A smidgen of your spit.
