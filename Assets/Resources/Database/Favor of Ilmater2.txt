The target becomes immune to nonlethal damage, charm and compulsion effects, and attacks that function specifically by causing pain.
It is further immune to effects that would cause it to be dazed, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, staggered, or stunned.
The target remains conscious at -1 to -9 hit points and can take a single action each round while in that state.
If any of the above conditions were in effect on the target at the time of casting, they are suspended for the spell's duration.
(Thus, an unconscious target becomes conscious and functional).
When the spell ends, any effects suspended by the spell that have not expired in the interim (such as fatigue, which normally requires 8 hours of rest to abate) return.
Effects that expired during the duration of this spell do not resume when it ends.
In addition to these effects, the target gains the benefit of the Endurance feat for the duration of the spell.
