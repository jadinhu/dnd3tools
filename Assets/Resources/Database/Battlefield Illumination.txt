When you cast battlefield illumination, a soft light illuminates the area.
This effect improves the illumination in the area by one category (from darkness to shadowy, or from shadowy to bright light).
It does not stack with other magical light effects.
Unlike other spells with the light descriptor, battlefield illumination counters and dispels early twilight (see page 126) but does not affect other darkness spells.
