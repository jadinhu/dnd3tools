You draw molten lava up through the ground.
Every creature within the area that fails a Fortitude saving throw takes 10 points of fire damage per caster level and catches on fire (see Catching on Fire, page 303 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Furthermore, anyone wearing metal armor who fails the saving throw is also affected as though by a heat metal spell.
A successful saving throw negates the heat metal effect and halves the damage.
Structures and unattended objects automatically take full damage (no save).
Erupt leaves its entire area a blackened ruin incapable of supporting plant or animal life for a full year.
