You conjure forth an incorporeal white wolf with abnormally large, frosty jaws.
This phantom wolf follows your mental commands, acting on your behalf as long as it remains within range and you continue to concentrate on it.
The phantom wolf appears where you designate and acts as you direct on your turn.
You don't need to maintain line of effect once the spell is cast, but the spell ends if the phantom wolf is ever outside the spell's range.

Frightful Presence: Creatures of less than 12 HD within 30 feet of an attacking phantom wolf must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be frightened for 3d6 rounds.
An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to that same phantom wolf's frightful presence for 24 hours.
Incorporeal Traits: A phantom wolf is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.
It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons.
It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will.
Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them.
An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be.
