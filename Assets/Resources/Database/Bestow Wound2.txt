If wounded, you can cast this spell and touch a living creature.
The target takes damage equal to your wounds at the rate of 1 point of damage per your caster level, or the amount needed to bring you up to your maximum hit points, whichever is less.
At the same time, you heal that much damage, as if a cure spell had been cast on you.
