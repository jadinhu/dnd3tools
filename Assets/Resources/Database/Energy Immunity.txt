This abjuration grants a creature and its equipment complete protection against damage from one of the five energy types ï¿½ ;acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
Energy immunity absorbs only damage, so the recipient could still suffer side effects such as drowning in acid, being deafened by a sonic attack, or becoming immobilized in ice.
Note: Energy immunity overlaps protection from energy and resist energy.
So long as energy immunity is in effect, the other spells absorb no damage.
