<b>A multihued glow of metallic colors surrounds you. The swirling glow manifests as a thin mist that forces itself up into your nose. Suppressing a sneeze, you note with excitement the unmistakable scent of treasure.</b>
	
You can detect copper, silver, gold, platinum, and gems within 30 feet, as well as differentiate between the five kinds of valuables.
	
When you detect one of these types of valuables, the exact location of the source is not revealed ï¿½ ;only its presence and direction. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the treasure, you can pinpoint its exact location. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
