With a sudden flash of insight, you know exactly where to turn and which streets to travel.
This spell imparts to you the most direct route to a type of location within 1 mile.
In this instance, a location is defined as a particular sort of building or establishment.
For example, you could learn the route to the nearest tavern, temple, or blacksmith's workshop.
You can't obtain directions to a specific location, such as the shop of Rufus the blacksmith.
Additionally, the location's purpose must be publicly known.
If the thieves guild secretly operates out of a warehouse, you can't obtain directions to the &quot;headquarters of the thieves guild&quot;, because that is not publicly available information.
