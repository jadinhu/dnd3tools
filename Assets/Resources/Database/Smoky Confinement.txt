At your touch, your foe dissipates into a thick smoke, which flows smoothly into the receptacle you have prepared.
You transform the subject into smoke or gas, which is then stored inside the focus.
The subject remains trapped within the focus, unaware and ageless.
If the focus is ever broken or opened, the victim resumes his normal form in the same space as the focus.
Focus: A tiny receptacle, such as a bottle or vase, of crystal or a similar material worth at least 100 gp.
The receptacle must be able to be sealed.
