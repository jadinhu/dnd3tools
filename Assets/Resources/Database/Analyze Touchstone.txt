If you study an area for 1 round, you know the location of any touchstone in the area.
Once you find a touchstone, you can study it.
(If you find more than one touchstone � ;an extremely rare occurrence � ;you can study only one at a time).
Each round you study a touchstone, you can discover one property of the touchstone, in this order:			The base ability gained by someone who takes the Planar Touchstone feat related to the site.		Any conditions that must be met in order to recharge the higher-order ability granted by the site.		The higher-order ability gained by someone who visits the touchstone and fulfills the recharge condition.		The number of uses of the higher-order ability that the character gains from visiting the site and fulfilling the recharge condition.	
For each of these properties, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15.
If you fail, you can try again in the next round.
