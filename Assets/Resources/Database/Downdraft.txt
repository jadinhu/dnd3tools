<b>Downdraft</b> sends a column of turbulent air rushing towards the earth. Airborne creatures caught in the area of a downdraft must succeed on a Reflex save or immediately plummet up to 100 feet straight downward, taking falling damage (1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen) if the downdraft makes them hit the ground or collide with an object. Those who succeed on the Reflex save plummet only 50 feet.
