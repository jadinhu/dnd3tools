<b>You invoke the spell and your eyes begin to glow with a rippling pearly radiance, like those of a noble ghaele eladrin.</b>
	
Inspired by the deadly gaze of the noble ghaele eladrin, you gain a gaze attack usable against creatures within 60 feet. If an evil creature with 5 or fewer Hit Dice meets your gaze (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 294), it dies unless it succeeds on a Will save. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a fear spell (PH 229) for 2d10 rounds.
	
Non-evil creatures and evil creatures with more than 5 Hit Dice are not slain by the gaze, and they suffer the fear effect only if they fail the Will save.
