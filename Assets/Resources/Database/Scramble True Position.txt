You utter truenames for directions with great rapidity as you gesture toward where you're casting the spell.
With a sizzle and a flash, those within the spell's radius disappear, then reappear somewhere nearby.
The scramble true position spell can wreck an enemy's carefully constructed defenses or highly regarded plan of attack by randomly moving them around.
You can't control where your enemies reappear, but they might fall off a precipice or wind up between your rogue and fighter allies.
When you cast the spell, make a single Truespeak check.
Then compare your result to the DC to move each creature: 15 + (2 x CR).
If you meet or exceed the DC for a creature, move that creature 2 squares in a random direction using the &quot;targeted on square&quot; part of the diagram on page 158 of the Player's Handbook.
The scramble true position spell can't send a creature into a square occupied by solid matter or another creature, but it can send a creature into a dangerous place (into lava or off a cliff, for example).
Make the comparison and movement in descending CR order.
If multiple targets have the same CR, the caster chooses the order in which to relocate them.
If you can't move a target 2 squares in a particular direction, move it 1 square, or it disappears and reappears in the same square if relocation is impossible.
Having their true locations disrupted with this spell can be disorienting for the subjects.
Every creature that you move with this spell (even those who reappear in the same square they started in) must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the truenames for cardinal directions and movement, which you learn with the spell.
This check has no set DC, but if your Truespeak check result is lower than 15 + (2 x creature's CR) for the lowest CR creature in the area, then scramble true position has no effect.
