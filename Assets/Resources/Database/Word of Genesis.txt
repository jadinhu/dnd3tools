From the silvery haze of the Astral plane, you begin to weave tendrils of mist as you speak words of power.
Floating in space, you begin to construct reality anew with your words and gestures.
You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane.
Demiplanes created by this spell are very small, very minor planes.
This spell works best when cast while you are on the Astral Plane (various spells allow access to these planes, including plane shift and gate).
Casting this spell creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane.
At first, the fledgling plane has a 100-foot radius.
Once created, it grows by 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per year).
Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using plane shift or some other spell or permanent link that you arrange for separately.
You determine the environment within the demiplane when you cast word of genesis, reflecting most any desire you can visualize.
You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain.
This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create objects or constructed elements (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth).
You must add these details in some other fashion if you desire.
You can't create lingering magical effects with this power; you have to add those separately, if desired.
Similarly, you can't create a demiplane out of esoteric material such as silver or uranium; you're limited to stone and dirt.
You can't manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as the Material Plane.
Once your demiplane is complete, you can cast the spell again and again, each time increasing its radius by another 100 feet.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the truename of the place you're creating; the Truespeak DC is 50.
XP Cost: 1,000 XP.
