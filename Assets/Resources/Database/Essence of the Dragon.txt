With the touch of your bloodied hand, your ally's appearance shifts.
Her eyes become slitted, and a shimmer of scales ghosts momentarily across her skin.
You confer the dragon type on the touched creature.
For the duration of the spell, that creature counts as a dragon for the purpose of spell effects, magic item wielder requirements, favored enemy bonuses, and other factors that depend on a creature's type.
The subject of the spell is immune to magic sleep and paralysis effects and ignores the frightful presence of dragons.
The recipient also receives darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
It is also now vulnerable to harmful effects that specify dragons, such as dragon bane weapons.
Material Component: A drop of blood from a dragon or dragon-descended creature.
