You create a downpour of acid that douses the area for 1 full round, dealing 7d6 points of acid damage to every creature in the area.
The ground within the area becomes muddy and/or slick from the downpour, and remains in that condition for a number of rounds equal to the caster's class level.
Movement in the area is halved, though a creature can move at normal speed by making a DC 10 Balance check.
Failure on the check means it cannot move in that round, and failure by 5 or more results in the creature falling prone.
Material Component: A flask of acid (cost 10 gp).
