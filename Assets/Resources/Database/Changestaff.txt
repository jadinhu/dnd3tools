You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall.
When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant (see the Monster Manual).
The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands.
However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees.
If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed.
Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell.
The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.
Focus: The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared.
The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).
You cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during the shaping and carving of the staff.
