As you cast the spell, a ghostly, grasping hand appears to reach inside your foe, pull out a black, cloudy mass before disappearing.
This spell functions as spurn the supernatural, except that its effect is permanent and it eliminates only one supernatural ability, no matter how high your Truespeak check.
Your target loses the chosen supernatural ability until it undergoes a ritual of renaming or is the target of a wish or miracle spell.
If the subject has a temporary supernatural ability (such as those granted to binders by vestiges), it loses that ability, but this spell does nothing to prevent the subject from gaining the same or other supernatural abilities later.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the personal truename of the creature you're targeting.
XP Cost: 500 XP.
