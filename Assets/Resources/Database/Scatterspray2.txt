You can point to a collection of little, unsecured items and cause them to fly off in all directions simultaneously.
The spray of items makes a burst with a 10-foot radius.
If the items are fairly hard or sharp (such as stones, sling bullets, coins, or the like), creatures in the burst take 1d8 points of damage.
A successful Reflex save negates this damage.
Eggs, fruit, and other soft objects can be used, but the damage then dealt is subdual damage.
