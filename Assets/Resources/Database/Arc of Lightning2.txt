You create natural conductivity between two creatures, and a bolt of electricity arcs between them.
This bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to both creatures and to anything in the line between them.
Both creatures must be in range, and you must be able to target them (as if this spell had them as its targets).
Draw the line from any corner in one creature's space to any corner in the other's space.
Arcane Material Component: Two small iron rods.
