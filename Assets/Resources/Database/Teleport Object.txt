This spell functions like <b>teleport</b>, except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces (such as a <b>delayed blast fireball</b> bead) cannot be teleported.
	
If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted <b>dispel magic</b> spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.
