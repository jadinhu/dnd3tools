This spell functions like <b>lesser planar exchange</b>, except as noted here. You trade places with a leonal guardinal (MM 142), barbed devil (MM 51), or hezrou demon (MM 44). The called creature has full access to all its abilities, with one exception: A demon or devil you conjure can't summon other creatures. If the creature is slain, you take 4d6 points of damage and the spell ends.
