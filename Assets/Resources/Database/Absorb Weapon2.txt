You can harmlessly absorb any light weapon you touch (even a poisoned one) into your arm, as long as it is not in another creature's possession.
The absorbed weapon cannot be felt under the skin and doesn't restrict your range of motion in any way.
An absorbed weapon cannot be detected with even a careful search, although a detect magic spell reveals the presence of a magical aura.
The only evidence of the weapon is a faint blotch on the skin that's shaped vaguely like the weapon.
When you touch the spot (an action equivalent to drawing a weapon), or when the spell duration expires, the weapon appears in your hand and the spell ends.
An intelligent magic weapon gets a saving throw against this spell, but other weapons do not.
