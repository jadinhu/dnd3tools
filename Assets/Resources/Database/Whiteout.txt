A swirling snow and a strong wind arise around you or a creature you designate, and follows you or the creature from that point on.
Characters in whiteout conditions take a -2 penalty to AC, lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, move at half speed, and take a -4 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks, as well as Search, Spot, and any other checks that rely on vision.
The character also gains total concealment (50% miss chance).
These effects end when the character leaves the area of whiteout.
Whiteout conditions stack with wind and snowfall.
Visibility is 5 feet.
In addition, any creature trying to move within the effects of this spell must make a Survival check (DC 10 + caster level) every move action or wander lost inside the whiteout.
A creature that fails can't leave the area, but can move around within it.
Groups of creatures roped or otherwise physically held together can use the lead creature's Survival check and stay together.
A new check can be made once per minute.
