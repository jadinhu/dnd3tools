<b>You release a drab violet ray from your palm. The ray shoots toward your target in a spiraling corkscrew.</b>
	
You strike out at your enemy with a ray that causes intense feelings of vertigo. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A struck subject experiences strong feelings of vertigo and can take only a move action or a standard action each round (but not both, and it cannot take a full-round action).
