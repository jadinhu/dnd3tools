You command the waters to lift a creature or object and propel it forward.
An object so lifted may contain creatures or other objects.
What the wave can lift depends on your caster level.
Standing wave moves the lifted creature or object in a straight line at a speed of 60 feet over water.
The spell dissipates when the wave contacts land, lowering its burden harmlessly to shore.
