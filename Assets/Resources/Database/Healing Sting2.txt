<b>Your palms tingle as you smash the dead wasps between your hands. The tingling intensifies as you strike the opposing warrior, pulling his vitality into yourself.</b>
	
Focusing the power of negative energy, you deal 1d12 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum 1d12+10) to a living creature and gain an equal amount of hit points if you make a successful melee touch attack. A healing sting cannot give you more hit points than your full normal total. Excess hit points are lost.
