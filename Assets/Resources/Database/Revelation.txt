A burst of purple light reveals all that is hidden.
Revelation creates an area in which all things appear as they actually are.
The burst reveals objects in the same way as a true seeing spell, though it lasts for only 1 round.
Unlike with true seeing, all creatures in visual range can see the effect of the spell.
The spell does not dispel any magical effects ï¿½ ;it only temporarily reveals them.
Should a creature pass through the burst during its duration, any hidden elements on it are revealed, though they are again hidden as soon as the creature steps out of the area.
Material Component: A clump of dandelion fluff and herbs worth 50 gp.
