A soft, comforting glow emanates from the object you've touched, filling the entire area with light and warmth.
Though seemingly gentle, the light pierces the shadows like the rays of the sun.
The object touched sheds light as a daylight spell (PH 216).
In addition, every living creature within the area of bright light (a 60-foot radius) gains fast healing 1.
This effect ends for a given creature if it moves out of the area of light but resumes should it reenter.
Any undead creature within the area of light takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage per round.
An undead creature that is particularly vulnerable to sunlight (such as a vampire) instead takes 2d6 points of damage per round.
A successful Fortitude save negates this damage, but the affected creature must repeat the save every round, whether it succeeds or fails.
If the undead creature has spell resistance, the spell must overcome it to deal damage.
Rejuvenating light counters and dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level.
