Though this spell was originally created by the phaerimms, it has since been stolen by spellcasters of other races and can now be found in grimoires across FaerÃ»n.
Backblast protects you in the same manner as the spell turning spell, except that it turns only spells with the fire descriptor that are targeted on you.
Effect and area spells are unaffected, as is any spell with a range of touch.
The DM secretly rolls 1d4+2 to determine the total number of spell levels that can be turned.
Backblast otherwise follows the rules for the spell turning spell.
In addition to the above, backblast grants you fire resistance 10.
This effect persists until the end of the round in which the spell turning effect ends.
