You cause the skeleton of the target to become thicker and as strong as stone.
This gives the target a +3 natural armor bonus to AC.
The spell has no effect on creatures that have no skeleton but works normally on creatures that have exoskeletons (such as insects).
Another version of the spell is rumored to exist that works on living creatures, but causes wracking pains because of the radical alteration of its skeleton.
This version has fallen out of use because few creatures willingly subject themselves to it (although it might be used by sadistic followers of Orcus).
Focus: A miniature skull carved of granite.
This spell first appeared in Magic of FaerÃ»n.
