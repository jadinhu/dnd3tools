You put the recipient into a deathlike condition.
At your option, this can be a cataleptic state that is impossible to distinguish from death, or the subject can appear to be in a coma or deep sleep.
Although able to smell, hear, and know what is going on, the subject is blind and has no sense of touch or pain.
The subject does not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
While the spell is in effect, the subject is immune to subdual damage, and any normal or ability damage inflicted is reduced by half.
In addition, the subject is immune to mind-affecting attacks, paralysis, poison, disease, and energy drain.
The effects of any poison or disease already affecting the subject when the spell takes effect are halted until the spell ends.
If the subject has any negative levels when the spell takes effect, the saving throw to remove it is delayed until the spell ends.
