Shadow Hand (Strike)
 <b>Level:</b>  Swordsage 3 (One Shadow Hand maneuver),    
<b>Components:</b>

 <b>Target:</b> One creature
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude half

 	
<b>Liquid, black energy covers your weapon. As you strike your opponent, this material flows into the wound, spreads along his veins, and leaves him weakened.</b>
	
As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against an opponent. In addition to dealing normal melee damage with the attack, you deal 4 points of Strength damage. A successful Fortitude save (DC 13 + your Wis modifier) halves this Strength damage, but has no effect on the normal melee
damage you deal with the strike.
	
This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
