This spell allows you to draw iron or steel objects to yourself by projecting a magnetic ray at any object within range.
The magnetic ray draws objects toward you with an effective Strength score of 30.
Each round the spell lasts, you can target one item with a ranged touch attack.
If you hit an item that another creature is holding (such as a weapon), you and the creature holding the item must make opposed rolls, as if you were making a normal disarm attempt.
You add your base attack bonus and the ray's Strength bonus (+10) to your roll.
Your opponent uses a melee attack roll, modified by +4 if she is using a weapon in two hands.
If the weapon is larger or smaller than your size, your opponent gets an additional +/-4 per size category difference.
If you win the opposed roll, the weapon flies from your opponent's hand to your own.
If you hit an attended item, such as a weapon at someone's belt, the creature wearing the item can make a Reflex save to keep hold of the item.
If you hit an unattended item that is not secured or too heavy for the ray to lift, it flies to your hand.
If the item is secured in some way, you can make a Strength check (using the Strength bonus of the ray) to break or burst whatever is securing it.
Material Component: A piece of lodestone.
