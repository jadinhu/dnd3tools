This spell enables the caster to make an ordinary instrument perform as if it were of masterwork quality.
For the duration of the spell, the instrument grants the user a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks, or an alternate effect as described in Chapter 3 for that instrument type, if desired.
Fine-tuning has no effect if cast upon an instrument already of masterwork quality.
Focus: The target of the spell.
