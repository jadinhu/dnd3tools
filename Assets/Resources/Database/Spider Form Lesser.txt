As the transformation finishes, your skin hardens into a dark exoskeleton.
You take on the form and abilities of a Medium fiendish monstrous spider (MM 289).
You are treated as having the spider's Hit Dice (2) for the purpose of adjudicating the special abilities gained from the fiendish template.
You gain 5 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration.
