Your muscles ripple with the memory of ancestral strength, tensing for quick action.
This spell causes your body to recall the strength of your forebears, hearkening back to a time when your ancestors constantly struggled for survival.
You gain a +5 competence bonus on Climb, Jump, and Swim checks.
If primal hunter is active on you at the same time as primal instinct, primal senses, or primal speed, you gain uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature).
If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you gain improved uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature; your barbarian level for the purpose of being flanked equals your caster level).
Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), you can cast this spell as a swift action.
