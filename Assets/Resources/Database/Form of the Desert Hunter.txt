Brass scales grow from your flesh as a thick mane surrounds your face.
Your arms and legs become powerfully muscled and grow sharp claws as your body hunches over to become quadrupedal and a small pair of batlike wings sprouts from your shoulder blades.
You take the form of a dragonne (MM89).
You gain 30 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration.
