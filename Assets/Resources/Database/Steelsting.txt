You create a brief maelstrom of flying darts of force that spin, slice, and rebound within the area.
Each creature within the area is targeted by 1d3+1 melee attacks from these darts (check for each creature separately).
The darts strike with an attack bonus equal to your caster level + your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively), dealing 2d6 points of damage per hit.
The name is a misnomer, for the spell creates neither steel nor a true sting.
