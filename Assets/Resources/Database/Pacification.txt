You calm your target by exhaling a peaceful breeze.
This spell allows you to exhale a calming breeze, soothing one creature of your choice.
The creature is affected as if by a calm emotions spell for as long as you concentrate, up to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level.
You cannot affect creatures with more Hit Dice than you have caster levels.
