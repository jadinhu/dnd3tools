A quick buildup of icy blue energy centered on your hand rapidly becomes an enormous bubble of frost that washes out over the landscape, freezing all in its path.
You create a burst of icy energy that flash-freezes any creatures within the spell's area.
The spell deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d6 points).
Any living creature reduced to -1 or fewer hit points is not killed, but instead turned to solid ice (similar to flesh to stone,
but with ice instead of stone).
Effectively, the spell can't reduce a creature's hit points below -9.
A successful Fortitude save halves the damage.
A creature turned to solid ice by this spell gains hardness 10 as well as immunity to cold and electricity.
However, it also gains vulnerability to fire, and any frozen creature reduced to -10 or fewer hit points by fire damage immediately melts (and dies).
Once this occurs, the creature can be brought back to life only with a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell.
Special: A character who learns this spell gains resistance to cold 5, which stacks with any other resistance to cold he already possesses.
