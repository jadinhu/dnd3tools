This spell creates shuriken formed of magic fire that you can throw as a normal ranged attack at any target within range.
You are automatically considered proficient with the fire shuriken, which have a range increment of 10 feet, threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and deal 3d6 points of fire damage each on a successful hit (though you and your possessions take no damage as the shuriken are thrown).
Any additional damage dealt by the fire shuriken (including Strength and sneak attack bonuses) is also fire damage.
The shuriken disappear when they hit, so they cannot set fire to combustibles or damage objects.
You can create one fire shuriken per three caster levels, up to a maximum of six at 18th level.
Material Component: A shuriken coated with pine sap and sulfur.
