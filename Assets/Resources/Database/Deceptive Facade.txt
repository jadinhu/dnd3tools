After an instant to lock the appropriate image in your mind, your touch brings it to life, spreading a new image across the canvas of reality.
Deceptive facade allows you to alter the appearance of another being or object.
When cast on another creature, it functions as disguise self,
except that it can affect a target other than yourself.
When cast on an inanimate object or a structure, the spell allows you to alter the object's visible characteristics.
You might change its color, make it appear to be made of a different material or substance, increase or decrease its apparent size by up to 10 percent, or modify other cosmetic details.
Deceptive facade does not alter any other sensory properties of the target.
A creature that interacts with the glamer can make a Will save to recognize the illusion, just as with disguise self.
