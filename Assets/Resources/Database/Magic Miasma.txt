<b>A thick, sparkling cloud of billowing mist rolls into being from the point you indicate.</b>
	
This potent spell conjures a cloud of mist that functions as a <b>solid fog</b> spell (PH 281). In addition, any spells cast within the fog have a -4 penalty to the spellcaster's caster level, and the save DC of any such spell is reduced by 2. Creatures within the fog, or that enter the fog, must succeed on a Will save or suffer the reduction in caster level and DC even after they leave the fog, for the duration of the spell.
	
Material Component: A small piece of quilted cloth, which must be soaked in water while the spell is cast.
