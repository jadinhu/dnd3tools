An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling limbs springs into existence.
The limbs resemble your own forelimbs.
Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage.
If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.
Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save.
The wall of limbs provides one-half cover (+4 AC, +2 Reflex saves) against attacks made through it.
