This spell places a magical light source inside a glass sphere roughly the size of a human fist.
You may control the light level generated by a Nchaser's glowing orb by mental command, provided that the orb is within 30 feet of you.
The light level ranges from no light at all to illumination within a 60-foot radius.
There is no limit to the number of Nchaser's glowing orbs you may possess, and you may control their light levels independently or in concert.
If a Nchaser's glowing orb is smashed, the magic is lost.
If you die, however, the orbs retain their enchantment.
Any cleric, sorcerer, or wizard capable of casting 4th-level spells may gain control of a dead character's orbs simply by touching them.
Focus: The glass sphere into which the light is placed.
An orb usable for this purpose has a hardness of 0 and 2 hit points each.
