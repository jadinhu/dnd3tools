You invest your weapon with the power to bleed away part of the victim's essentia.
Each time you hit a living creature with a weapon affected by soulbleed wounding, that creature loses 1 point of essentia unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.
You don't gain the essentia; it is simply lost.
Spell resistance applies against this effect.
If any round of the spell's duration goes by in which no living creature is affected by the spell (either because you didn't hit a living creature or because no saving throw was failed), you take 1d6 points of damage from the spell.
No save or spell resistance is allowed to resist this effect.
This spell works only as long as you wield the weapon affected.
Any other wielder gains no benefit from the effect.
