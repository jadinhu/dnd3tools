You can carry more weight aloft while flying, and your flight lasts longer than normal.
You can fly at normal speed when wearing medium armor or carrying up to a medium load.
If your ability to fly (whether natural or magical) has a limited duration, that duration is doubled.
This spell lasts as long as you remain airborne; it ends the moment you land.
