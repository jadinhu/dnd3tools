<b>Celestial Fortress</b>(Champions of Valor)

Conjuration (Creation)
 <b>Level:</b>   Sanctified 4,   
<b>Components:</b>V, S, DF, Sacrifice

 	
This spell functions like Leomund's secure shelter, except as noted above and as follows.
The structure is a simple flat-roofed fort rather than a cottage.
It has a sturdy door and a fireplace but no windows; access to the roof is through a ladder and a sturdy hatch.
The fortress resonates with the power of your deity's home plane, and it is protected by consecrate and magic circle against evil.
The fortress's appearance reflects your deity and deity's realm.
For example, Mystra's forts created by this spell look like high-fantasy castles, those of Mulhorandi deities look native to their land, those of dwarven deities look very dwarflike, and so on.
Sacrifice Component: 1d2 points of Constitution damage.
