<b>Pangs of loneliness grip your heart as you complete the spell. Upon choosing your target, the feeling subsides even as a ghostly pale yellow mist swirls around your target for a moment.</b>
	
You manipulate the senses of one creature so that it perceives itself to be the only real creature in all of existence and everything around it to be merely an illusion.
	
If the target fails its save, it is convinced of the unreality of every situation it might encounter. It takes no actions, not even purely mental actions, and instead watches the world around it with bemusement. The subject becomes effectively helpless and takes no steps to defend itself from any threat, since it considers any hostile action merely another illusion.
