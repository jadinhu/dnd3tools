You lower the temperature in the affected area to the level of extreme cold (as defined under Cold Dangers, page 302 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
For every minute spent in the area, a creature vulnerable to cold takes 1d6 points of lethal damage (no save).
In addition, a creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage.
Those wearing metal armor, as well as those coming in contact with metal that has been in the area for at least 1 hour, are affected as if by a chill metal spell.
This spell was originally developed as a means of preserving food (cast inside cellars), but wizards quickly determined that it could be used as a deterrent (on long hallways or in treasure vaults, for example) or for creating a comfortable environment for cold-loving pets.
Darsson's chilling chamber can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
