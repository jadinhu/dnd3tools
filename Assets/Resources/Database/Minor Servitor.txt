You imbue an inanimate object with mobility and a semblance of life.
The animated object is friendly toward you.
You have no special empathy or connection with the object, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.
The object can be of any nonmagical material, including wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, and glass.
You can also animate masses of raw matter, such as water, a rock from a wall, or a rock on the ground, as long as the volume of material does not exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level.
For each cubic foot of volume, the animated object has 1 Hit Die.
The object gains an Intelligence score (roll 3d6) and a Charisma score (roll 1d3) from the spell.
Other statistics for animated objects are found in the Monster Manual.
Material Component: A piece or handful of material of the same type as the object to be animated.
XP Cost: 250 XP per cubic foot of material affected.
