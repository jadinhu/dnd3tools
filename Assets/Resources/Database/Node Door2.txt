You instantly transfer yourself from your current earth node to any other earth node you have visited.
You always arrive exactly at the spot desired ï¿½ ;whether by simply visualizing the area or by describing your destination (for example, &quot;the earth node that serves the kuo-toa as a secret temple to Blibdoolpoolp&quot;).
After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn.
If you arrive in an earth node that is already partially occupied by a newly added object, you arrive in the closest clear space in that node.
If the earth node is completely filled or has been destroyed by any means, you bounce to the next closest earth node (determined randomly or by the DM).
Each such &quot;bounce&quot; deals you and any who accompany you 2d6 points of damage.
Special: You must have the Node Spellcasting feat to cast this spell.
