You invite the soul-energy of a long-departed mishtai (see the rilkan and skarn race descriptions in Chapter 1) to share a living body.
The would-be host must have an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of at least 5.
The mishtai that you channel is drawn from one particular era of the millennia of ancient mishtai history, and it possesses a particular station in the highly ordered mishtai society.
The mishtai helps or hinders but does not control the subject.
Roll 1d6 and consult the table below to determine the nature of the mishtai that shares the subject's body and its effects upon him (if the subject is a skarn or rilkan, roll 1d10 instead).
Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in this spell extends the duration by 1 minute.
