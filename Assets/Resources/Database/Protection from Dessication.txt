The warded creature gains temporary immunity to dehydration of any kind.
While protected by the spell, the subject cannot become dehydrated even if it takes dessication damage.
Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage from dehydration per caster level (maximum 100 points), whether that damage is dessication damage or nonlethal damage, it is discharged.
