This spell functions like stinking cloud, except as noted above and as follows.
You exhale a 10-foot cone of stinking gas.
Though the cone persists for only 1 round, creatures who succumb to its effects are still nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the area of the cone.
A creature that has a special saving throw bonus against poison may apply that to its saving throw against this spell.
Creatures immune to poison are unaffected by fetid breath.
Legends maintain that this spell was created either by the yuan-ti or by an arcane worshipper of Khostren.
Material Component: A clove of garlic or an onion, which you must eat.
