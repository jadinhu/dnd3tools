<b>With the roar of a wild beast, you throw yourself into the fray. Your weapons are little more than a blur as you hack at your foe with feral speed.</b>
	
With a ferocious howl, you throw yourself into combat. You move with such speed and ferocity that when you reach your enemy, you unleash a blistering flurry of slashes, cuts, and hacks.
	
As part of initiating this maneuver, you make a charge attack. Instead of making a single attack at the end of your charge, you can make a full attack. The bonus on your attack roll for making a charge attack applies to all your attack rolls.
