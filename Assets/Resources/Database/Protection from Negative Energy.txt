The warded creature gains partial protection against negative energy effects.
Subtract 10 from the hit point damage dealt by any negative energy effect (such as inflict spells) that affects the warded creature.
Negative energy effects that don't directly deal hit point damage (such as energy drain) affect the target normally.
