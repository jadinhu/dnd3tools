You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been cursed or carries a curse.
You can determine the general nature of the curse with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20).
In scanning a cursed scroll, you could learn that the curse causes misfortune to the reader, but you could not tell the specific effects.
If you succeed at the Spellcraft check, you receive a +4 bonus to your effective level when casting remove curse on the item or person analyzed with this spell.
Note: The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
