When you cast this spell, you literally strip the flesh from a corporeal creature's body, inflicting incredible pain and psychological trauma.
Each round, the target takes 2d6 points of damage, 1d6 points of Charisma damage, and 1d6 points of Constitution damage.
A successful Fortitude save negates the ability damage, reduces the hit point damage by half, and ends the spell.
In each round when the target creature is affected, it gets a new save.
Flensing has no effect on creatures in gaseous form.
Material Component: An onion.
