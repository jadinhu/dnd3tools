You transform a volume of water into an equal volume of acid, which deals damage to creatures that come into contact with it.
You cannot transform water inside a creature's body, but you can affect water surrounding it.
Water containing more than a trace of dissolved or suspended substances can't be affected by this spell.
You can fill a flask with acid produced in this way and throw it as a splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of acid damage on a direct hit and 1 point of acid damage from a splash (see page 128 of the Player's Handbook).
Each round a creature is in contact with the acid, it takes 1d6 points of acid damage.
Underwater, the acid created by this spell dissipates after 1 round/caster level.
The acid dissolves metallic objects it contacts.
It deals 1d6 points of damage per round and ignores the object's hardness.
A magic item makes a Fortitude saving throw each round for half damage.
Material Component: A few drops of vinegar.
