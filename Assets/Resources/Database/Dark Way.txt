You create a ribbonlike, weightless, unbreakable bridge.
The dark way must be anchored at both ends to solid objects, but otherwise can be at any angle.
Like a wall of force, it must be continuous and unbroken when formed.
It is typically used to cross a chasm or a hazardous space.
Creatures can move on the dark way without penalty, since it is no more slippery than a typical dungeon floor.
You (but not anyone else) gain a +5 competence bonus on all Balance checks while made on the dark way.
The dark way can support a maximum of 200 pounds per caster level.
Creatures that cause the total weight on the dark way to exceed this limit sink through it as if it weren't there.
You never sink through the dark way unless your own weight exceeds the spell's maximum capacity.
