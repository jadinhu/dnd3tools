Your hand is suddenly covered in warm condensation as a jet of burning steam bursts from your finger.
You release a powerful jet of superheated steam that deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4) to each creature within its area.
The jet begins at your fingertips.
The jet of steam deals no damage to objects in its path, nor can it set fire to combustibles.
