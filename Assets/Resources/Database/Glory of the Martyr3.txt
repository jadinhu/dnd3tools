Like shield other, this spell wards the subjects, creating a mystic connection between them and you that transfers some of their wounds to you.
Each subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
In addition, each subject takes only one-half the normal hit point damage from any attack, and you take the remainder.
Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, ability damage, level draining, and disintegration, are not affected.
If a subject's hit points are reduced because of a lowered Constitution score, that reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage.
When the spell ends, any subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subjects, but the damage you took for the subjects is not reassigned to them.
If you die while glory of the martyr is in effect, the spell ends in a burst of positive energy that restores 1d8 hit points to each subject.
If a subject dies or moves out of range of the spell, that subject's connection to you is severed, but the spell remains in force with respect to other subjects.
If your connection with all subjects is severed, the spell ends.
Focus: A platinum ring worth at least 50 gp worn by you and each subject of the spell.
