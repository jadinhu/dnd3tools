<b>Wail of Doom</b>(Song and Silence: A Guidebook to Bards and Rogues)

 <b>Level:</b>  Bard 5,    
<b>Components:</b>V, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action
 <b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
 <b>Area:</b> Cone
 <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous (see text)
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes

 	
Anyone caught in the cone of this spell suffers excruciating pain and is disheartened and demoralized besides.
Each creature that fails its Will save takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level, suffers a -2 morale penalty on saving throws for 1 round per caster level, and flees from the caster for the same period.
A fleeing creature has a 50% chance to drop whatever it's holding.
It chooses a random path of flight away from the caster and flees any other dangers that confront it as well.
If cornered, the affected creature cowers instead of fleeing (see Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
