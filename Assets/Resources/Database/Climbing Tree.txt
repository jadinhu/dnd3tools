At your call, a tree snakes up from the earth, in seconds growing as tall as trees that have lived for years.
You cause a 1-foot-diameter tree to grow in the center of any adjacent square.
The tree can grow as high as 10 feet per caster level (to a maximum of 50 feet).
The branches are evenly spaced and perfect for climbing; ascending the tree requires a successful DC 5 Climb check.
The tree can grow only in soft terrain, such as dirt, soil, or sand.
The tree has hardness 5 and 120 hit points; if cut down, it vanishes instantly.
It can't be animated by any means, such as with animate plants, nor can it serve as the basis for any plant-related spell such as tree stride.
Treat the tree as a slender pillar (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 64) for terrain purposes.
