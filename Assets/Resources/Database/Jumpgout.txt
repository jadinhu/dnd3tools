You create a vertical pillar of roaring flame.
Creatures caught in the fire take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level, up to a maximum of 15d6.
On your next turn (the second round of the spell) the pillar vanishes and reappears up to 60 feet away from its original location.
If you maintain concentration on the spell on its second round (a standard action), you can choose the spot where the pillar reappears.
Otherwise, the pillar moves 1d6x;10 feet in a random direction.
Creatures caught in the pillar on the second round take 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 caster levels (Reflex half).
The pillar then dies away in a swirl of sparks.
