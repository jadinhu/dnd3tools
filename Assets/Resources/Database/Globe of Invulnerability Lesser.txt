An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower.
The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability.
Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe.
Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items.
However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe.
Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast.
The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area dispel magic.
You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.
Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.
For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a mirror image created by a caster outside the globe.
If that caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to reappear when the caster exited the globe.
Likewise, a caster standing in the area of a light spell would still receive sufficient illumination for vision, even though that part of the light spell's area that lies within the globe would not be luminous.
If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.
Material Component: A glass or crystal bead that shatters at the expiration of the spell.
