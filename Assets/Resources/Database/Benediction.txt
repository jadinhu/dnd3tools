You grant your comrade the luck of the gods.
With this spell, you can grant another creature a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws.
If the subject is also under another effect that grants saving throw bonuses, the effects stack.
In addition, at any point before the duration expires, the subject can choose to reroll a single attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check after seeing the result of the initial roll, but before finding out whether it succeeds or fails.
The higher of the two rolls applies.
Once this option is exercised, the spell ends immediately.
Unlike most touch spells, benediction cannot be used on yourself.
Its effects are for the benefit of others only.
