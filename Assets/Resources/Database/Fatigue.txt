The subject becomes fatigued, suffering an effective penalty of -2 to Strength and Dexterity.
A fatigued character cannot run or charge and becomes exhausted by doing something that would normally cause fatigue.
If the subject is already fatigued when you cast the spell, it becomes exhausted, moving at half normal speed and suffering an effective penalty of -6 to Strength and Dexterity.
The subject can negate the effects of the spell through normal rest.
The creature must rest for 8 hours to remove the fatigue.
