You create a sudden explosive burst that shatters ice bridges, breaks up river ice, opens frozen ponds, or damages an icy creature.
The ice broken covers a 10-foot radius per caster level, and a 1-foot depth per level.
Ice thicker than the spell's depth is cracked and weakened, but not broken all the way through.
Weakened ice is treated as one category thinner than it really is (see Table 1-2, page 11).
Creatures dropped from a bridge, through lake or river ice, or off a glacier or iceberg take normal falling and cold water damage.
Creatures on a glacier will have a crevasse open under them equal to the depth of the spell.
Targeted against an ice creature of any weight (such as an ice golem, winterspawn, or entombed), crack ice deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.
Material Component: A hammer carved from salt crystal (50 gp).
