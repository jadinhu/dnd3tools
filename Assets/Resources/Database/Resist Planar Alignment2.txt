<b>You can tell that your target feels the oppression of the plane around you, the rank evil of the place. A few spoken phrases, backed by magical power, and that oppression seems to lift.</b>
	
This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from a plane's alignment traits (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 149). When the subject visits a plane with an alignment trait, this spell grants it immunity to penalties on its Charisma-based checks that mildly aligned planes impose on visitors of opposed alignments. The Charisma-, Wisdom-, and Intelligence based check penalties associated with strongly aligned planes are halved while the spell's duration lasts.
