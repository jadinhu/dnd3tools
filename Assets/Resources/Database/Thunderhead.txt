Thunderhead creates a small thundercloud over the subject's head. The cloud moves with the subject, following it unerringly even if he becomes invisible or leaves the region. In every round of the spell's duration, a miniature bolt of lightning leaps from the thundercloud to strike the subject. Each bolt deals 1 point of electricity damage that is negated by a successful Reflex save.
