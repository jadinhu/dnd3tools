You sense the direction of the nearest planar touchstone and gain a vague sense of its power.
If you have visited the nearest planar touchstone and wish to exclude it from this divination, you instead gain knowledge of the next closest planar touchstone.
This spell allows you to locate planar touchstones located only on the plane on which it is cast.
Special: You must have the Planar Touchstone feat in order to cast this spell.
