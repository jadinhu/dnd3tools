You create a localized area of strong wind (approximately 30 mph). This effect has limited utility in battle (see Table 3 ï¿½ ;24: Wind Effects, page 95 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), but is often used to propel sailing craft. By concentrating as a full-round action, you can change the direction of the wind by 45 degrees.
	
This spell is effectively identical to the spell-like ability that can be gained by a character with the lesser Mark of Storm (see page 66 of the <span class="caps">EBERRON</span> Campaign Setting), except the range and the affected area are different, as given above.
