When you cast this spell, you flick a silk scarf at one creature within range, magically propelling it toward the target.
The scarf assumes an ironlike hardness on its way and then wraps around the target creature.
You must have line of sight to the target and hit with a ranged touch attack.
If you hit, the target must make a successful Reflex save or become entangled.
Focus: The silk scarf.
