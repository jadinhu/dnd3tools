You alter the physical properties of a metal object so that it runs like water.
The melted metal does not change temperature but flows as a liquid for 1 round and then returns to its normal solid state, usually in a form resembling a puddle.
If the object is a magic item, this renders it broken and nonfunctional, although a character with the appropriate item creation feat can repair it.
Material Component: A drop of mercury in a vial.
