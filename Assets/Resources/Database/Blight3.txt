This spell withers a single plant of any size.
An affected plant creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and may attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage.
A plant that isn't a creature (such as a tree or shrub) doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies.
This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.
