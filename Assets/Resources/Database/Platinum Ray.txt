With a gesture and a word, you fire a brilliant platinum ray at your target.
This spell calls upon the might of good dragonkind to suppress the powers of an evil dragon or dragonblood creature.
You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target.
If the attack is successful, the dragon must make a successful Will save or become unable to use all racial supernatural and spell-like abilities.
This does not include the spells a dragon casts from its sorcerer spell progression.
Special: If you receive your divine spells from Xymor (Bahamut), you receive a +1 sacred bonus on the ranged touch attack.
