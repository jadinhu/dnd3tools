A ring of ghostly fog surrounds the target's head.
With a swirl, the fog dissipates, leaving behind a crown made of human bones.
This spell creates a magic crown that grants its wearer the power to command undead.
Once per minute, the crown's wearer can issue a one-word order to an undead creature, as per the command spell.
The undead creature must make a Will save to resist this effect.
Even though command is normally a mind-affecting spell, the crown channels holy or unholy energy (depending on your alignment; neutral casters choose one or the other) to compel obedience.
In addition, a cleric who wears the crown can expend a use of his turn or rebuke undead ability to increase this ability's save DC by 4.
As an immediate action, the creature wearing a crown of the grave can discharge its magic to gain a +4 bonus on a single turn or rebuke undead attempt.
The spell ends after the wearer uses the crown in this manner.
The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm.
If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.
Material Component: A pinch of grave dirt.
Focus: A wooden hoop 6 inches in diameter.
