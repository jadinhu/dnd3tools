<b>You move in a blur, leaving scorch marks in your wake as you twirl around the battlefield, slicing into your foes as you move.</b> 
	
As part of this maneuver, you move up to your speed. Each time you exit a square adjacent to an enemy, you can first make a single melee attack against that foe. You cannot attack a single enemy more than once with this maneuver. Your movement provokes attacks of opportunity, as normal.
