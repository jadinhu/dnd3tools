<b>Mentally marking the appearance and location of the portal, you implant that knowledge into others, allowing them to be drawn to the portal like a loadstone to metal.</b>
	
You alter a magic gate or portal so it sends out a mental beacon for up to six creatures, including yourself if you choose. These individuals must be known to you but need not be present at the time of casting. Once you cast portal beacon, these creatures know the direction and distance to the targeted portal for the spell's duration.
	
Moving to a plane other than the two connected by the portal ends the spell for that creature but leaves it intact for others. You can have any number of portal beacons tuned to you without impairing other abilities or actions.
