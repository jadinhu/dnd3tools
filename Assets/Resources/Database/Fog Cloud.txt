A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate.
The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).
Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).
A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.
The spell does not function underwater.
