This spell eliminates normal inhibitions and silences the subject's conscience.
Under its effects, a good creature might commit acts of extraordinary evil without any feelings of remorse.
For instance, a paladin who strives to never destroy a foe that has surrendered might decide that she's better off meting out justice immediately and killing the enemy.
This spell affects the target's norms and expections; for example, once affected, a good-aligned target might be willing to attack his friends when urged to do so through a suggestion.
This would not eliminate his need to atone, according to the tenets and punishments prescribed by his faith or law.
The compulsion is permanent until broken by a break enchantment spell or similar magic, or until it is removed by the spellcaster.
Material Component:One piece of masterwork artwork of at least 1,000 gp in value.
The artwork must depict acts of debauchery or evil that are titillating and fascinating, not disturbing or revolting.
The spell is cast upon the artwork, which is then revealed to the subject of the spell, triggering its effects.
The enchantment on the artwork lasts for 1 day per spellcaster level, much like a symbol, until it is viewed and its magical effect is triggered.
