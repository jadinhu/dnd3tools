<b>With a leisurely wave and a declaration of boredom, you complete the spell. You instantly become aware of the location and types of objects in the spell's area, as if you had made a quick search.</b>
	
The subject of this spell knows the contents of a 20-foot-radius burst, as if it had taken 10 on a Search check for each object and space in the burst radius, including noting the location of traps (though only a rogue can locate those traps with a DC greater than 20).
