and ratlike tail as fine gray fur covers your
thickening skin.

Your face lengthens into a ratlike snout, and you gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points if you are Small) + 1-1/2 times your Str modifier. You also gain the benefit of the Weapon Finesse feat. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks.
