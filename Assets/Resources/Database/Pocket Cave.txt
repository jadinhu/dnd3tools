You conjure up an extradimensional cave that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast.
You can only cast this spell on a surface made of rock or some form of earth.
The entry point looks like a dark cave entrance that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high.
Only those you designate can enter the cave, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter.
You can open it again from your side at will.
Creatures entering the cave will find themselves in a dark, wet cavern.
The place contains enough oxygen to sustain as many creatures as can fit in the area for the duration of the spell.
Edible fungus grows along the walls, and condensation drips down one wall into a pool of fresh, clean water that never seems to run dry.
External conditions such as weather do not affect the pleasant atmosphere of the cave, and nothing except the designated creatures can pass through the portal in either direction.
At the end of the spell's duration, all within the pocket cave return to the spot where they entered the cave or else to the nearest open space, if that spot is occupied.
