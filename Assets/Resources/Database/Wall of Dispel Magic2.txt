This spell creates a transparent, permeable barrier.
Anyone passing through it becomes the target of a dispel magic effect.
A summoned creature targeted in this way can be dispelled by the effect.
The wall of dispel magic cannot be seen or felt by ordinary means, or even via a see invisibility spell.
Detect magic indicates the presence of the effect, and true seeing reveals both its presence and its purpose.
