Even if a battle is for a just cause, using <b>fireball</b> on a crowded city street places innocents at risk. The <b>shockwave</b> spell creates a burst of concussive force that disorients victims without causing any permanent damage, dealing 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to every creature within the area and dazes them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the dazed effect. The <b>shockwave</b> has no effect on nonliving creatures or objects. Creatures that are immune to nonlethal damage cannot be dazed by the spell.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A small crystal sphere.
