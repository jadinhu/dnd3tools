You attempt to suppress the functioning of a single magic item or soulmeld.
If you succeed on a caster level check against the item or soulmeld (against a DC of 11 + meldshaper level), the item or soulmeld loses all magical properties for the duration of the spell.
This is identical to the effect of a dispel magic spell targeted on an object, except for duration and your ability to invest essentia to improve your caster level check.
This spell has no effect on ongoing spell effects, even if those effects are on items (such as greater magic weapon).
Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in this spell grants you a +2 insight bonus on your caster level check to suppress the item.
If the spell fails to affect the item, the invested essentia immediately returns to your pool.
