This spell creates an immobile, swirling mass of greenish-white forms resembling tortured spirits.
One side of the wall, selected by you, emits a low groaning that causes creatures within 60 feet of that side to make a Will save or flee in panic for 1d4 rounds.
Any living creature that merely touches the wall takes 1d10 points of damage as its life force is disrupted.
A living creature passing through the wall takes 1d10 points of damage, as above, and must make a successful Fortitude save or gain one negative level.
The barrier is semimaterial and opaque, providing cover and total concealment against physical attacks, and it blocks magical effects (including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities).
Material Component: A clear cut gemstone.
