You create a wave of snow that knocks creatures in its path prone and deals 4d6 points of crushing damage plus 1d6 points of cold damage to targets caught in the cone.
Any creature making a Fortitude saving throw takes only half the cold damage from a snow wave; however, it still takes the full crushing damage.
In addition, anyone in the area must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone.
