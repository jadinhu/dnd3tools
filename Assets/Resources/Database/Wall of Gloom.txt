You create a barrier of ominous shadow that obscures vision and deters passage.
Creatures in squares adjacent to the wall have concealment against attacks from the other side, while creatures more than 1 square away have total concealment.
Although the wall is not substantial, a creature with 6 or fewer Hit Dice must succeed on a Will save or be halted at its edge, ending its move action (though a creatures can
move away from the wall or attempt to move through again if it has a second move action available).
A creature can attempt to pass the wall any number of times, but each previous failure imposes a cumulative -1 penalty on its Will save.
Wall of gloom counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
Material Component: A bit of fleece from a black sheep.
