You give a weapon the ghost bane property in addition to any other properties it has.
Against ghosts, your weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) is 2 higher than normal and it deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.
The spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon that already has the ghost bane property.
At caster level 9th and higher, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus if it is not already a magic weapon.
Alternatively, you can affect up to 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets.
The projectiles must be of the same type, and they have to be together, such as in the same quiver.
Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their ghost bane property when fired.
Any weapon affected by this spell glows with witchlight (see the Witchlight feat).
