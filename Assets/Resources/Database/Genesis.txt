You create an immobile, finite plane with limited access ï¿½ ;a demiplane.
Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes.
You can cast this spell only on the Ethereal Plane.
When you cast it, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane.
At first, the demiplane grows at a rate of a 1-foot radius per day to the initial maximum radius of 180 feet as the fledgling plane rapidly draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter.
You determine the environment in the demiplane when you first cast genesis, reflecting most any desire you can visualize.
You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the shape of the general terrain.
However, the spell does not create life (such as vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth).
If you want these benefits, you must add them in some other fashion.
Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, you can continue to cast this spell to enlarge your demiplane, adding another 360-foot-diameter bubble to it each time.
XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
