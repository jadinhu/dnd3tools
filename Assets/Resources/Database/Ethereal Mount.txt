On the Ethereal Plane, you may call into being one or more quasi-real mounts made of the protomatter of the plane.
These mounts only accept you and those that you designate as riders.
The mounts may appear as horses or any other commonly ridden mounts, but have a foggy, almost translucent nature, and their colors shift across the spectrum over time.
These mounts have AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex), and 10 hit points +1 hp per caster level.
They do not fight and have no attacks.
If reduced to 0 hit points, an ethereal mount melts into the ethereal fog from which it came.
An ethereal mount has a speed of 240 feet on the Ethereal Plane and can carry its rider's weight plus 10 pounds per level.
You can only cast this spell in the Ethereal Plane, and the ethereal mount never leaves the plane.
(If the Deep Ethereal is used in your cosmology, then the amount of time to reach destinations is halved while on an ethereal mount).
