This spell summons a greater elemental of your choice (air, earth, fire, or water) from the appropriate Elemental Plane.
It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn.
It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability.
You must concentrate on the spell's effect, but commanding the creature is a free action.
A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.
When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
