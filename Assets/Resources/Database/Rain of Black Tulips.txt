Tulips as black as midnight fall from the sky.
The tulips explode with divine energy upon striking evil creatures, each of which takes 5d6 points of damage.
In addition, evil creatures that fail a Fortitude save are nauseated (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, perform any task requiring concentration, or take anything other than a single move action per turn) until they leave the spell's area.
A successful Fortitude save renders a creature immune to the nauseating effect of the tulips, but not the damage.
Material Component: A black tulip.
