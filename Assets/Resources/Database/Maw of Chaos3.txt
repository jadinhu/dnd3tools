<b>Components:</b>V, S, M, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

 <b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Will partial
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes

 	
<b>At the culmination of casting the spell you open your mouth wide as if to yawn. In imitation, the air cracks and splits, opening into a yawning area of roiling blue-green energy resembling a great mouth.</b>
	
All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of damage per caster level in the round when you cast the spell and each round thereafter at the start of your turn. Those damaged must also make a Will saving throw or be dazed for 1 round.
Second, the chaotic energy makes it difficult to concentrate. Any activity that involves concentration (such as casting a spell or using a spell-like ability) requires a Concentration check (DC 25 + spell level) to succeed.
	
Creatures with the chaotic subtype are unaffected by this spell.
	
Material Component: A jawbone with teeth.
