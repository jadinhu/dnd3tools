<b>A black seed of magic floats above your finger, and you implant it in the creature before you, guarding it against positive energy.</b>
	
The warded creature gains partial protection against positive energy effects. For as long as the spell lasts, it subtracts 10 from the hit point damage dealt by any positive energy effect (such as a <b>cure</b> spell) that adversely affects it.
	
Positive energy effects that don't deal hit point damage to the subject, such as turning attempts, affect the subject normally.
