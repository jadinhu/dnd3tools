This spell creates a burst of black force.
The force burst causes 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and envelops the affected area in a sphere of force with a radius of 10 feet, trapping creatures within.
A successful Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the entrapment effect.
Creatures trapped inside cannot escape except by those methods that can bypass or destroy a wall of force.
This spell can be used in lieu of wall of force as part of creating a bead of force.
Material Components: A small piece of charcoal and a small piece of onyx.
