When laying your hand upon a living creature, you boost its life energy to grant it the fast healing ability.
The target heals 2 hit points per round until the duration expires.
This spell does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a creature to regrow or attach lost body parts.
The effect of the spell automatically stabilizes a dying character.
The effects of multiple remedy spells do not stack; only the highest-level effect applies.
Applying a second remedy spell of equal level extends the spell's duration.
