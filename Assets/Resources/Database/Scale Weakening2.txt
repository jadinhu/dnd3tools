<b>As you cast this spell, the snakeskin vaporizes. A dull gray ray projects from your hand. Where the ray strikes, your foe's skin seems brittle and more frail.</b>
	
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The subject's natural armor bonus is reduced by 1 point per three caster levels (maximum reduction 5 points at 15th level). This spell can't reduce a creature's natural armor bonus to less than 0, nor does it have any effect on an enhancement bonus to natural armor (such as that granted by the <b>barkskin</b> spell).
	
Material Component: A shed snakeskin.
