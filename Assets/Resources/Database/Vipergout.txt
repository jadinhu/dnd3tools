This spell summons 1d4+3 fiendish (CE) or celestial (CG) Medium-size vipers (snakes), which leap forth from your mouth to attack your enemies.
Starting on the round you complete the spell, you may spit forth vipers until you reach the number summoned by the spell.
You may spit three vipers as a standard action or one viper as a move-equivalent action.
Spat vipers land at your feet and act on your turn just as creatures summoned by a summon monster spell.
Until you have brought forth all the snakes summoned by the spell, you cannot speak, cast spells with verbal components, or activate items that require speech.
The snakes are not actually present in your mouth, and do not interfere with your breathing.
At the end of the spell, all the vipers disappear, and any not brought forth are lost.
When you use a summoning spell to summon an evil or good creature, it is a spell of that type.
Material Component: A snakeskin.
