You can use this maneuver any time you would be required to make a Fortitude save. Make a Concentration check instead of the Fortitude save and use the result of that check to determine the save?s success. You must use this maneuver before you attempt the Fortitude save. A result of a natural 1 on your Concentration check is not an automatic failure.</p
