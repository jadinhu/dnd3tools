This spell allows the caster to attract and capture an astral creature, as someone using the astral projection spell.
If such a creature is within range at the time of casting and fails its saving throw, it is brought instantly before the
caster and held motionless and visible for the spell's duration.
Spellcasters generally follow snare astral traveler with a more lasting restraint, such as trap the soul.
If more than one astral creature is within range, the closest creature is affected.
If that creature makes its saving throw, the next closest creature must make a save.
This continues until one creature fails its save or all have succeeded.
