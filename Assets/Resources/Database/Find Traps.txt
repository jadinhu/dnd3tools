You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps.
You can use the Search skill to detect traps just as a rogue can.
In addition, you gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (maximum +10) on Search checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect.
Note that find traps grants no ability to disable the traps that you may find.
