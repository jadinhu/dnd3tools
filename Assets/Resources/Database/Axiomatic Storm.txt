A driving rain falls around you.
It falls in a fixed area once created.
The storm reduces hearing and visibility, resulting in a -4 penalty on Listen, Spot, and Search checks.
It also applies a -4 penalty on all ranged attacks made into, out of, or through the storm.
Finally, it automatically extinguishes any unprotected flames and has a 50% chance to extinguish protected flames (such as those of lanterns).
The rain damages chaotic creatures, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round (chaotic outsiders take double damage).
In addition, each round, a gout of acid strikes a randomly selected chaotic outsider within the spell's area, dealing 5d6 points of acid damage.
After the spell's duration expires, the water disappears.
Material Component: A flask of axiomatic water (see page 76).
