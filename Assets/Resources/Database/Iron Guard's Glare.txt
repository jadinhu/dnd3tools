<b>With a quick snarl and a glare that would stop a charging barbarian in his tracks, you spoil an opponent's attack. Rather than strike his original target, your enemy turns his attention toward you.</b>
	
While you are in this stance, any opponent that you threaten takes a ï¿½ ;4 penalty on attack rolls against your allies. This penalty does not apply to attacks made against you. Enemies you threaten become aware of the consequences of the stance.
