The ground trembles as you cast this spell.
Suddenly, a yawning rift filled with black fire splits the ground, threatening to devour all.
This spell creates a rectangular rift in the ground.
You designate where the rift opens, but it must be in a straight line on relatively level ground.
Throughout the spell's duration, any conjuration spells with the evil descriptor that are cast within 60 feet of the rift function at caster level +2.
You cannot make the rift open beneath a fixed structure such as a tower, castle wall, or Daern's instant fortress.
However, you can make it open underneath a wagon, tent, or similarly mobile object or lightweight structure.
Untended objects wholly or partly in squares occupied by the rift fall in, taking 6d6 points of damage from the fall.
Any creature standing wholly or partly in the area where the rift opens must succeed on a Reflex saving throw or fall into it as well, taking a like amount of damage.
A successful save indicates that the creature avoids falling in by moving to the nearest safe square(s).
Anything that falls into the rift is scorched by black fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage per round and 6d6 points of divine energy damage per round.
Energy resistance or immunity does not protect against the divine energy damage.
On the second and third rounds of the spell's duration, black fire continues to fill the rift.
In addition, the rift sprouts black fiery tentacles that reach out to all creatures within 60 feet of the rift's edge.
Such creatures are entitled to a Reflex save each round to avoid the fiery tendrils; a creature that fails its save is lashed for 3d6 points of fire damage and 3d6 points of divine energy damage.
At the end of the spell's duration, the rift closes.
Anything still trapped inside the rift when it closes plane shifts (as the spell) to a random layer of the Abyss.
All that remains of the rift is a permanent scar on the ground where it formed.
Material Component: A miniature adamantine and gem-studded pickaxe worth at least 1,000 gp.
