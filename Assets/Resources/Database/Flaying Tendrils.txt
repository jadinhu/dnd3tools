A quartet of hideous, writhing tentacles sprouts from your face.
You grow four tentacles from your face, similar to those of a mind flayer.
For the duration of the spell, you can attack with one tentacle as a standard action, or all four as a full-round action.
Each tentacle deals 1d4 points of damage, plus your Strength modifier.
When using the tentacles, you are treated as though you have the Improved Grapple feat.
You can latch a tentacle onto a foe's head with a successful grapple check, and if you begin your turn with one tentacle successfully attached, you can attach the remaining three with a single check, though doing this still requires a full-round action.
Your foe can escape with a single grapple check or Escape Artist check, but you gain a +2 bonus for each tentacle that is attached at the beginning of your foe's turn.
If you begin your turn with all four tentacles attached, you can attempt to remove your foe's brain, killing him instantly.
The victim is entitled to a fortitude save to avoid this fate, though success indicates only that he evaded extraction; he is still grappled and must attempt to escape normally.
You cannot use these tentacles to grapple foes more than one size category larger or smaller than you.
Extracting the brain does nothing to constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, or undead, and is not instantly fatal to creatures with multiple heads.
