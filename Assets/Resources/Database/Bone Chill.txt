A ray of burning cold erupts from your fingertips.
Corporeal undead struck by the ray are covered in a layer of ice, rendering the subject immobile as if held.

(This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity).
Material Component: A small piece of bone and a 1-inch cube of ice.
