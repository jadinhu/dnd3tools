Your mind opens to the secrets of the cosmos and briefly touches the omniscience of the gods.
You gain a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks.
At any point before the duration expires, you can make a check with a Knowledge skill in which you have no ranks, or retry a Knowledge check you have previously failed.
The +5 insight bonus still applies in both of those cases, but utilizing this option reduces the spell's remaining duration to 1 minute/level.
If you worship a deity who grants access to the Knowledge domain, the bonus is +10 rather than +5 ï¿½ ;even if you did not choose that domain.
