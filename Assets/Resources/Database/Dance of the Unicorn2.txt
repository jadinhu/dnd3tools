You surround yourself with a purifying swirling mist with a radius of 5 feet per caster level that washes the air clean of smoke, dust, and poisons.
Nonmagical contaminants, including inhaled poisons, are automatically negated within the cloud.
Magical effects, including acid fog, cloudkill, and green dragon breath, are negated only if your level is greater than the offending spell's caster level (or the dragon's HD).
If your level is lower than the caster level, the dance of the unicorn grants everyone within the mist a +4 bonus on their saving throws against the effect.
The cloud of mist leaves everything within its area damp.
