Time seems to wind back upon itself, giving you another chance to act.
By means of this spell, any single unsuccessful action may be attempted again with the same chance of success. 

For example, a failed hit in combat could be repeated, an incorrect guess to a question could be repeated as if the first answer had never been given, a rogue who fails to pick a lock may try again, etc. After the spell is cast, it lasts for 24 hours or until discharged. 

Any time within that period the caster may invoke the effect regardless of his or her initiative count. This does not count as an action.
However, the caster must do so immediately (within one initiative count) after the failed action in order for the spell to take effect.

Note that this spell cannot be used to "erase" a successful action that failed to produce desirable results (such as successfully opening a sealed casket only to find a vampire inside).

Material Component: A bit of mithral worth at least 100 gp
