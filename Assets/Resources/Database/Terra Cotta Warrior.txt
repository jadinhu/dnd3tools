This spell turns an innocuous statuette of decoration and devotion into a full-sized warrior, ready to fight your foes.
The statuette becomes a Medium animated object (Medium construct, 35 hp, AC 14, hardness 6, speed 40 ft., attack slam +2, damage 1d6+1) that attacks a specified target on your turn as directed by you.
You can change the designated target as a move action (as if directing an active spell).
The statuette can be reused if the terra cotta warrior remains intact at the end of the spell, but if the warrior is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the statuette is lost.
See page 13 of the Monster Manual for full information on animated objects, but the terra cotta warrior has none of the given attack forms.
Focus: A terra cotta statue of a warrior, up to 6 inches tall and costing 1 gp.
