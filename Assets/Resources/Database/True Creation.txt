You create a nonmagical, unattended object of any sort of matter.
Items created are permanent and cannot be negated by dispelling magics or negating powers.
For all intents and purposes, these items are completely real.
The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level.
You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to make a complex item, such as a Craft (bowmaking) check to make straight arrow shafts or a Craft (gemcutting) check to make a cut and polished gem.
Unlike the items brought into being by the lower-level spells minor creation and major creation (see the Player's Handbook for those spell descriptions), objects created by the casting of true creation can be used as material components.
Material Component: A small piece of matter of the same type of item you plan to create � ;a sliver of wood to create arrow shafts, a tiny piece of the appropriate stone to create a polished gem, and so forth.
XP Cost: The item's gold piece value in XP, or a minimum of 1 XP, whichever is more (see the Player's Handbook for item costs).
