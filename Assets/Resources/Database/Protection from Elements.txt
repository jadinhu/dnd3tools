As endure elements, but protection from elements grants temporary invulnerability to the selected energy type. When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of elemental damage, it is discharged.
	
Note: Protection from elements overlaps (and does not stack with) resist elements and endure elements. If a character is warded by protection from elements and one or both of the other spells, the protection spell absorbs damage until it is exhausted. If a character is warded by resist elements and endure elements at the same time, the resist spell absorbs damage but the endure spell does not.
