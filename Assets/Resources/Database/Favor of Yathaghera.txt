You give the target creature large feathered wings in the manner of a pegasus, allowing it to fly with a speed of 100 feet (average maneuverability).
The creature reacts to these wings as if they were naturally part of its body and can use them immediately.
Ride checks to manipulate the mount are made as if it were not flying (so a rider familiar with horses can handle a flying horse just as easily as a normal one).
The spell gets its name from the Elvish name for Lurue: Yathaghera the Winged Queen, ruler of the pegasi and unicorns of Evermeet.
