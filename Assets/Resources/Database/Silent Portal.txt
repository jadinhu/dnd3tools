This simple cantrip negates the sound of opening and closing a single portal (door, window, gate, drawer, chest lid, and so on).
Even the squeakiest door opens without a sound when under the effect of this spell.
Silent portal covers only normal means of opening and closing the targeted portal.
Breaking a window or kicking a door in still makes noise, but opening a door that is falling off its hinges does not (since this is the normal way a door would open).
Portals composed of magical energy are not affected by this spell.
In the case of magic or even intelligent portals, spell resistance and a Will save (DC 10 + caster's ability score modifier + other modifiers as appropriate) apply.
