This spell creates an immobile, swirling mass of greenish-white forms that look like tortured spirits.
One side of the wall, selected by you, emits a low groaning that causes creatures within a 60-foot spread to make a Will save or flee in panic for 1d4 rounds (this is a sonic fear effect).
The barrier is semimaterial and opaque, providing total concealment.
It blocks magical effects and provides nine-tenths cover against physical attacks.
Creatures can easily move through a spiritwall, but at a cost.
A living creature that merely touches the wall takes 1d10 points of damage as its life force is disrupted.
1 living creature that actually passes through the wall takes 1d10 points of damage, as above, and must make a successful Fortitude save or receive one negative level.
Material Component: A clear, faceted gemstone.
