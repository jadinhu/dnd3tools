You may alter a magic portal so it sends out a mental beacon for up to six creatures, including yourself if you choose.
These individuals must be known to you but need not be present at the time of casting.
Once you cast portal beacon, these creatures always knows the direction and distance to the targeted portal.
Moving to a plane other than the two connected by the portal ends portal beacon for that creature but leaves it intact for others.
You may have any number of portal beacons tuned to you without impairing other abilities or actions.
