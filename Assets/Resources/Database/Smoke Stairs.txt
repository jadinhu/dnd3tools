You step into intangible smoke and ascend as nimbly as if it were a flight of steps.
You gain the ability to run up columns of smoke as if they were normal stairs.
Casting this spell successfully requires smoke from a natural fire large enough to fill a 5-foot square, such as a normal campfire, bonfire, or any significant amount of burning debris (torch f lames or creatures made of fire or smoke do not suffice).
After casting this spell, you can move into the column of smoke produced by such fires and can ascend vertically into a square filled with smoke.
To your eyes the smoke coalesces into ghostly steps, though other observers see nothing different.
When stepping into the column you are considered to be in the smoke above the flame and take no damage from the fire.
Every 5 feet of upward movement costs 2 squares of movement.
For example, an assassin with a speed of 30 feet casts smoke stairs on himself, then moves 10 feet across the ground to a smoking fire and ascends 10 feet vertically in a single move action.
If anything dissipates the column of smoke while you are moving though it using this spell, you lose your footing and fall.
Examples include a gust of wind spell and an air elemental's whirlwind form.
If the fire creating the smoke is extinguished, the smoke stairs effect lingers for 1 round before dispersing.
Material Component: A handful of dried leaves.
