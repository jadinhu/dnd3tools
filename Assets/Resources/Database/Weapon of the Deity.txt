You must be using your deity's favored weapon to cast this spell.
You may use the weapon as if you had proficiency with it even if you normally do not.
The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls and an additional special ability (see the list below).
A double weapon gains this enhancement bonus and special ability for only one of its two heads, as chosen by the caster.
When you reach 9th caster level, the enhancement bonus of the weapon increases to +2.
At 12th level, the bonus rises to +3, at 15th level it is +4, and at 18th level it is +5.
The list below includes deities from the core pantheon only, along with the five alignment components.
If a cleric worshiping a different deity casts this spell, the DM should assign an appropriate special property of the same power level as those listed here.
