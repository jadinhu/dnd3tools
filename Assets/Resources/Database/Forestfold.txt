You change your coloring and attune your footfalls to one specific kind of terrain (aquatic, desert, plains, forest, hills, mountains, marsh, or underground).
While you are in terrain of that kind, you gain a +20 competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.
You retain these bonuses even if you leave the designated terrain and return within the duration of the spell.
