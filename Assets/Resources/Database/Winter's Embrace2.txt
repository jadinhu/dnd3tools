A target that fails its save takes 1d8 points of cold damage per round at the beginning of your turn. Each round, the subject can make a new Fortitude saving throw to avoid taking damage that round. The second time a subject takes damage from a single casting of winter's embrace, it becomes fatigued. The fourth time it takes damage from the same spell, it becomes exhausted.
