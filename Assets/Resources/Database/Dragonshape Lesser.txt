You feel a fire burning deep within you.
	
Crimson scales quickly grow over your body, a pair of great wings sprouts from your shoulders, and the scent of sulfur fills the air as you transform into a dragon. You take the form of a Large young red dragon (see below). You gain 60 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration. For details, see The Polymorph Subschool on page 60.
