When you cast this spell, a sword blade of crackling electrical energy appears in the hand of the creature you touch (who must be a willing recipient).
It is the size of a normal longsword, but is virtually weightless.
It is treated as a martial weapon for purposes of determining who is proficient with its use.
The wielder can use the blade in two ways ï¿½ ;to make a melee touch attack to deliver electrical damage, or to fire a bolt of lightning as a ranged touch attack with an absolute range of 30 feet.
Over the entire duration of the spell, the blade can deliver damage up to 1d6 per caster level (maximum 10d6).
For any given attack, the blade's wielder decides (before making an attack roll) how many dice the blade deals with a successful hit, up to the maximum damage potential remaining in the spell.
If the attack roll is successful, the blade deals the specified damage to the target.
If the attack roll misses, those dice of damage are lost.
Since the blade is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier does not apply to the damage, which is all electricity damage.
It can harm any creature that is harmed by electricity.
The spell does not function underwater.
