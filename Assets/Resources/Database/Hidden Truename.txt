You chant a personal truename in an ever-quieter voice as you slowly lower your hand and crouch, trying to erase traces of the personal truename from the cosmos.
The subject gains protection from those who would use her personal truename for ill purposes, and a modicum of defense against utterances that use more general truenames.
The subject of a hidden truename spell gets a +2 bonus on saving throws against utterances.
In addition, those trying to research the personal truename of a creature protected by hidden truename take a -8 penalty on the Knowledge check required to do so.
(Truename research rules are detailed on page 196).
Truename Component:When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the personal truename of the creature you're trying to protect.
