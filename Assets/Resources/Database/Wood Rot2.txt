Any wood item or plant creature you touch becomes instantaneously rotted, decayed, and worthless, effectively destroyed.
If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius (a large wooden door), a 3-foot-radius volume of the wood is rotten and destroyed.
Wooden magic items are immune to this spell.
You may employ wood rot in combat with a successful melee touch attack.
Wood rot used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from wooden armor or shields (up to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered).
Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp.
You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the weapon.
A wooden or wooden-hafted weapon that is hit is destroyed.
Note: Striking at an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity.
Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around.
Against plant creatures, wood rot instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack.
The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.
Material Component: A live termite.
