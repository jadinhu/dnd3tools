<b>The flying creature lets out a surprised howl and then plummets to the ground, its wings flat against its body and struggling against a green glowing net.</b>
	
A web of force surrounds the target, entangling it like a net. This spell functions like <b>earthbind</b> (page 76), except that an ensnared creature immediately falls to the ground, taking falling damage. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check against a DC equal to the save DC of the spell. Like a <b>wall of force</b> (PH 298), this web of force is impervious to most attacks: It is immune to damage of all kinds, cannot be burst with a Strength check, and is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. Also like a wall of force, the web is immediately destroyed by disintegrate, a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction.
