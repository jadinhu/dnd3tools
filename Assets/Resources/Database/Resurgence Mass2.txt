<b>Throwing out your hand and calling upon your deity for favor, you give your allies a chance to free themselves of the baleful magic.</b>
	
This spell functions like <b>resurgence</b>, except as noted here. The spell grants a second save attempt against a single spell or ability chosen by you. For instance, if three of your allies have been mind blasted by mind flayers and two others have been turned into toads by baleful polymorph spells, you must choose to affect either the mind blast (granting three new save attempts) or the baleful polymorphs (granting two new save attempts).
