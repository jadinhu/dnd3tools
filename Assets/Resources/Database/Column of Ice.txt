A column of ice rises from the ground, lifting any object or creature (including you) standing in the area into the air.
Creatures making a Reflex saving throw can choose to avoid the column.
Moving or fighting atop the ice column requires a DC 10 Balance check.
Those who fail fall prone and must immediately succeed on a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or slip off the column, taking commensurate falling damage.
Creatures atop the column as it rises may be smashed against the ceiling or other overhead obstructions, which deals 4d6 points of damage.
