This powerful variant of the contingency spell automatically transfers you and everything you carry or touch (except for other creatures or objects that weigh more than 50 pounds) to a locale you name.
When casting Elminster's evasion, you must specify the locale and detail up to six specific conditions that trigger the spell.
When any of these situations occurs, your body, mind, and soul are whisked away to the location.
The location can be any place you have visited, even on another plane.
Also when casting the spell, you cast teleport without error and one or two other spells that are to take effect when you arrive at your destination.
The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for all castings.
If the companion spells have combined casting times longer than 10 minutes, use the combined casting times instead.
The teleport without error spell whisks you through the Astral Plane to your destination, so anything that prevents astral travel also foils Elminster's evasion.
The spells to be brought into effect by the evasion must be ones that affect your person (feather fall, levitate, fly, teleport, and so on) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third of your caster level (maximum 6th level).
The conditions you specify to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general (see the contingency spell, in Chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook).
The spell pulls together your mind, body, and soul if they have been separated.
For example, if your soul is trapped in a magic jar when the evasion is triggered, your soul returns to your body.
(This breaks the magic jar spell).
If your body or soul has been magically trapped (for example with a binding, imprisonment, or trap the soul spell),
you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the person who cast the trapping spell).
If you succeed, the trapping spell is broken and the evasion works.
If you fail, the evasion fails.
If you're dead when you arrive at your destination, your soul immediately departs just as though you died at your destination.
Material Components: Those of the companion spells, plus quicksilver; an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature; and some of your own blood, freshly drawn.
Drawing the blood deals 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage.
Focus: A statuette of you carved from ivory and decorated with gems (worth at least 1,500 gp).
You must carry the focus for the evasion to function.
XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
