This spell transforms a volume of water into an equal volume of colorless, tasteless, ingested poison with a save DC equal to the spell's DC.
When ingested, the poison deals 1 point of Constitution damage followed by 1d8 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later.
A successful Will save can negate each instance of damage.
A single swallow (1 ounce) of poison is enough to affect a single creature; drinking more does not increase the effect.
Material Component: The fang of a poisonous snake and a bloodstone worth at least 50 gp.
