You shroud yourself with invisible negative energy so that nonintelligent undead perceive you as a fellow undead creature, ignoring you.
Your appearance does not change, and while intelligent undead do not immediately recognize you as alive, they are likely to question whether you are actually undead.
If used in conjunction with a disguise or illusion to appear undead, this spell gives you a +5 bonus on your Disguise check.
If you attack an undead creature while this spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends.
When you are using this spell, inflict spells heal you and cure spells hurt you.
You are treated as if you were undead for the purposes of all spells and effects that specifically affect undead.
A successful turning (or rebuking) attempt against you (treating you as an undead of your Hit Dice) requires you to make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + cleric's Cha modifier) or be panicked (or cowering) for 10 rounds.
A successful turning attempt against you that would destroy (or command) an undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will save (DC 15 + cleric's Cha modifier) or be stunned (or charmed as by charm monster) for 10 rounds.
Material Component: Dust or bone fragments from any destroyed undead creature.
