Your comrade's body grows denser and stronger beneath your touch.
You grant the subject a limited resistance to ability damage.
You choose one of the three physical ability scores � ;
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution � ;when you cast the spell.
Body ward absorbs the next 5 points of damage dealt to that ability score, regardless of its source.
If, for instance, an ally you had warded against Strength damage were subsequently poisoned for 6 points of Strength damage, she would take only 1 point.
The spell lasts until its duration expires, or until the 5 points of protection are used up, whichever comes first.
When cast multiple times upon the same subject, body ward has a synergistic effect.
If you use it to affect two physical abilities simultaneously, it wards each against 8 points of damage.
If you use it to affect all three physical abilities at once, it wards each against 10 points of damage.
To achieve this synergy, the multiple castings must occur in subsequent rounds.
The benefits from multiple castings of body ward that protect the same ability score do not stack.
