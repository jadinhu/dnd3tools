As <b>Create deathless</b>, except that this spell allows you to create an undying councilor, a more powerful and intelligent deathless creature. 
	
Your campaign may include additional types of deathless creatures. Your DM will inform you if you can create different creatures with this spell. (For example, if you are using <b>Book of Exalted Deeds</b>, a character can create a crypt warden or a sacred guardian using this spell.) No spell can create an ascendant councilor.
