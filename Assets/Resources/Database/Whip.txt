This spell creates a whip formed of magical force; the spell also grants you the ability to wield this whip with proficiency.
Simply cracking the whip creates a sonic, mindaffecting effect that keeps normal animals (not beasts, magical beasts, or vermin) at bay unless they succeed at a Will saving throw.
Affected animals stay at least 30 feet away from you for the duration of the spell.
If you succeed at a normal ranged attack with the whip against any normal animal, the target animal must succeed at a Will saving throw or become frightened.
Frightened creatures suffer a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws, and flee from you as well as they can.
If unable to flee, creatures may fight.
You can use the whip in combat against other opponents as if it were a normal whip.
Material Component: A small silk whip.
