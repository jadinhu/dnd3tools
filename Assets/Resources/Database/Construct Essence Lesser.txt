When this spell is cast upon a living construct, it takes on more of the qualities of a true construct. The living construct gains the moderate fortification armor special quality, negating critical hits and sneak attacks 75% of the time. As well, the living construct gains low-light vision and immunity to nonlethal damage and stunning.
	
If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of <b>lesser humanoid essence</b>, both spells are dispelled and have no effect. It has no effect if cast on a creature under the effect of humanoid essence or greater humanoid essence.
