This spell causes stabbing pains even greater than those of Nybor's gentle reminder.
The target creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or die instantly.
If he survives, the subject is dazed for 1d4 rounds unless he succeeds on a Will save.
Regardless of whether he succeeds on this second save, the subject takes a -2 penalty on all attacks, saving throws, and checks while the spell lasts.
Nybor's stern reproof distracts spellcasters, who must make Concentration checks to cast spells while under its effects (see the Concentration skill description in the Player's Handbook).
Focus: A slender gold-chased adamantine rod 1 foot long, worth at least 1,000 gp.
Note: This spell first appeared in Magic of FaerÃ»n.
This version supersedes the one originally printed there.
