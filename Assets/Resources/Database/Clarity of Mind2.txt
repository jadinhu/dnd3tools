You grant the subject a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against all spells with the charm, compulsion, or glamer descriptors.
Clarity of mind also reduces any miss chance the target might have when attacking an opponent that has
concealment from a glamer spell (such as blur and displacement) by 10%.
Thus, a subject that attacks an opponent protected by a displacement spell suffers only a 40% miss chance, instead of the customary 50%.
