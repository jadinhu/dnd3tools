You may create a translucent prison of pure crystalline force around a target on the Ethereal Plane.
You must be able to see or otherwise target the creature you wish to affect.
The target affected by the chamber cannot move on either the Ethereal Plane or its coterminous planes for the duration of the spell but is otherwise unaffected.
The target cannot move onto another plane while inside the chamber, including returning to the Material Plane.
The target within the crystalline prison cannot physically attack or be attacked is and unaffected by most spells and supernatural abilities.
Gaze attacks and sonic spells may function through the walls of the crystalline prison, but the target of those attacks gains a +2 bonus on saving throws.
The target of the chamber may attempt to break the crystalline prison by making a Strength check (DC 10 + caster level).
A disintegrate spell brings down the chamber.
This spell only affects the Ethereal Plane, so it has no effect on planes not coexistent with the Ethereal Plane.
It has no effect on creatures on the Material Plane.
Material Component: A piece of translucent glass.
