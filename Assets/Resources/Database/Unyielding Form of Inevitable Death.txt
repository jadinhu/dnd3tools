Your flesh turns into solid onyx, and your muscled fists crackle with the unbridled power of thunder and lightning.
You take the form of a marut (MM 159), including the full plate armor normally worn by such a creature.
You gain 50 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration.
You can use each of the marut's at-will spell-like abilities (such as dimension door) once per casting of the spell, but you don't gain access to any of the marut's 1/day or 1/week spell-like abilities (such as chain lightning or earthquake).
See the Polymorph Subschool sidebar on page 91 for more details.
