This spell functions like <b>light of Lunia</b>, except that a softy pearly radiance is created. Your light rays deal 3d6 points of damage, or 6d6 points of damage against undead and evil outsiders. Alternatively, you can choose for the ray to heal 1d6 points of damage + your divine spellcaster level (maximum 1d6+10) to a living, non-evil creature.
