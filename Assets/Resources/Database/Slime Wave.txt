You create a wave of green slime that begins at the range you choose and violently spreads to the limit of the area. The wave splashes and splatters as it passes; some slime clings to any wall or ceiling. Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact, and even dissolves metal. Each creature is covered with one patch of green slime.
	
A patch of green slime deals 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage per round while it devours flesh. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignoring metal's hardness but not that of wood. It does not harm stone.
	
On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (applying damage to the victim as well). Extreme cold or heat, sunlight, or a remove disease spell destroys the green slime. Unlike normal green slime, the slime created by this spell gradually evaporates, disappearing by the end of the duration.
