<b>Death Dragon</b>(Spell Compendium, p. 60)

Necromancy [Evil, Fear, Mind-Affecting]
 <b>Level:</b>  Cleric 7,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, DF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 round
 <b>Range:</b> Personal
 <b>Effect:</b> Dragon-shaped armor of energy and bones
 <b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)

 	
<b>You summon unholy power to gird yourself in a dragon-shaped cocoon of bones and negative energy.</b>
	
The cocoon created by this spell gives you a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. You are treated as armed when you make unarmed attacks, and you deal damage as if your limbs were short swords of an appropriate size. You can use your off hand to attack, incurring the standard two-weapon fighting penalties (<b>PH</b> 160). The cocoon prevents you from casting spells with somatic, material or focus, (but not divine focus) components, but does not otherwise hinder your actions or movement.
	
As a standard action, you can project a cone of fear or make a melee touch attack to use inflict critical wounds on the creature touched (the caster level of these effects equals your own). These effects are otherwise identical to the spells of the same names, but have saving throw DC equal to what this spell's save DC would be if the spell allowed a save.
