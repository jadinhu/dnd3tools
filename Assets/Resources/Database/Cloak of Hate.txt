Living beings view the subject of this spell with instinctive hostility.
All <span class="caps">NPC</span> reactions begin one category worse than they
otherwise would (see page 72 of the Player's Handbook), and any Diplomacy checks to moderate those reactions take a &#8211; 10 circumstance penalty.
Furthermore, people view the target in the worst possible light.
If, for example, a community is hunting for an unknown murderer, they will assume that the subject of the spell is guilty of the crime.
Player characters and NPCs who know the subject well, such as old friends or loved ones, are unaffected.
Material Component:One ounce of bile.
