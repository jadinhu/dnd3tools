You draw forth the ebbing life force of all nearby badly wounded creatures and use it to fuel your own power.
Upon casting this spell, you radiate a consumptive death field.
All creatures in the area with fewer than 0 hit points that fail their saving throws die, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points per death caused by this spell and +2 Strength until the spell's duration expires.
Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by 1 per death caused by this spell, to a maximum of 1/2 your original caster level, improving spell effects that are dependent on caster level.
(This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells).
Creatures that fall to -1 hit points or lower in the area after the spell is cast are likewise subject to its effect.
No creature can be affected by this spell more than once per casting, regardless of the number of times that the area of the spell passes over them.
