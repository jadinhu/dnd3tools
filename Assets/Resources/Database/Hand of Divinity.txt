You give the subject a protective aura of divine energy that allows her a bonus on all saving throws.
If your patron is nonevil, this is a +2 sacred bonus and the spell is a good spell.
If your patron is evil, this is a +2 profane bonus and the spell is an evil spell.
This spell only works on a creature with the same patron as you or the same alignment as your patron.
If cast on a target that does not meet these criteria, there is no effect.
