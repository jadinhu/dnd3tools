The subject becomes invulnerable to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage.
The spell absorbs damage the subject would otherwise take from all the above energy types, regardless of whether the source of damage is natural or magical.
This protection also extends to the subject's equipment.
When the spell has absorbed a total of 12 points of damage per caster level dealt by any combination of the above energy types, it is discharged.
Protection from all elements absorbs only damage.
The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice.
The effects of this spell do not stack with those of protection from elements, endure elements, or resist elements.
It a creature is warded by protection from all elements and any of these other spells, protection from all elements absorbs damage until it is discharged.
