This spell causes grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees to grow thorns and then wrap and twist around creatures in or entering the area.
Creatures that make their save against this spell are unaffected other than having to move at half speed within the area of affect.
If a creature fails its initial saving throw, it has three options: stay perfectly still, attempt to break free from the thorns, or continue to act normally.
A creature that fails its save but stands perfectly still is entangled (-2 attack, -4 Dexterity), but experiences no other effect and takes no damage.
Anyone entangled in this way loses the entangled condition if they leave the area of the spell.
Each round in which a creature remains in the area, it may spend a full round action extricating themselves from the thorns.
Doing so allows for a new saving throw.
If successful, the creature is unaffected by the thorns except it may only move at half speed in the area of the spell.
Successfully breaking free in this way is the only thing a character can do that does not cause thorn damage to the character.
A failed attempt to break free deals the normal 2d6 thorn piercing damage.
Those that attempt actions (such as attack, cast a spell with a somatic component, or move) take 2d6 points of piercing damage from the thorns.
A creature that tries to cast a spell must also make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level + damage taken) or lose the spell.
The plants provide cover.
A creature 5 feet away has cover.
Creatures separated by 20 or more feet of briar webs have total cover.
