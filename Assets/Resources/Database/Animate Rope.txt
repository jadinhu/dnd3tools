You can animate a nonliving ropelike object, such as string, yarn, cord, line, rope, or even a cable. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half.
	
The possible commands are &quot;coil&quot; (form a neat, coiled stack), &quot;coil and knot&quot;, &quot;loop&quot;, &quot;loop and knot&quot;, &quot;tie and knot&quot;, and the opposites of all of the above (&quot;uncoil&quot;, and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.
	
The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it � ;it does not snake outward � ;so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inchdiameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.
	
The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.
	
This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope.
	
The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.
