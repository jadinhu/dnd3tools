You unleash a tremendous bolt of sonic energy from your open hand, dealing 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to each creature within its area.
In addition, a resonating bolt deals full damage to objects and can easily shatter or break interposing barriers.
If the bolt destroys a barrier, it can continue beyond it if its range permits; otherwise, it stops.
