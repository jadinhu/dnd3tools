You reduce the target animal's size by one category.
For example, a Large tiger affected by this spell becomes a Medium-size tiger.
This decrease in size allows the animal to fit better into tight spaces, such as the typical dungeon room or subterranean passage.
The size change also has a number of other effects, as given in the Monster Manual and summarized below.
If this spell would cause any ability score to drop to 0 or below, that score instead becomes 1 while all other effects apply normally.
Huge to Large: The subject loses 8 points of Strength, 4 points of Constitution, and 3 points of natural armor, while gaining 2 points of Dexterity, a +1 bonus to AC, and a +1 bonus on attack rolls.
