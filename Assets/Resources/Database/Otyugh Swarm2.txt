Otyugh swarm creates otyughs from a large collection of refuse and filth, such as a sewer or cesspool.
You can choose to create 3d4 ordinary otyughs or 1d3+1 Huge otyughs with 15 HD (see page 14 of the Monster Manual).
The otyughs willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards.
They remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss them.
If the otyughs are created only for guard duty, the duration of the spell is seven months.
In this case, the otyughs can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location.
Otyughs summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range.
You must create the otyughs in an area containing at least 6,000 pounds of sewage, refuse, or offal.
After you cast the spell, otyughs not summoned for guard duty may leave the area of offal at your command.
