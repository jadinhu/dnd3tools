You create a large hemispherical tortoise shell measuring 5 feet in diameter.
It has 100 hit points, hardness 10, and can float if turned on its back.
You can move it as if it weighed only 10 pounds.
To anyone else, it weighs 500 pounds.
It stands vertically on its own, providing up to nine-tenths cover from half the battlefield, or you can pull it down over yourself like a shelter.
You can change the shell's orientation as a standard action that doesn't incur an attack of opportunity.
Up to four Small creatures, two Medium-size creatures, or one Large creature can fit under (or in) the shell.
Focus: A whole turtle shell.
