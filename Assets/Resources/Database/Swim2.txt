This spell gives the recipient the ability to swim with the ease of a fish, though it does not impart the ability to breathe water.
The creature can swim at its normal (land) speed without making Swim checks, so long as it is not carrying more than a light load.
It gains a +8 competence bonus on any Swim checks to perform some special action or avoid a hazard, though it still suffers the normal penalty for weight carried (-1 per 5 pounds carried).
It can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened when swimming.
The creature can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
If the creature is carrying more than a light load, it still gains the +8 competence bonus on Swim checks, but it must make Swim checks to move (including the normal penalty for weight carried).
The other benefits of the spell still apply.
Material Component: A goldfish scale.
