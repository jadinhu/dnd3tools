Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish.
A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature.
You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action.
You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).
A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5.
A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.
Focus: Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end.
