You create a magical connection between you and an ally such that any spells targeting the ally (rather than an area or effect) are redirected to you.
For example, magic missiles cast at your ally target you instead.
Both you and your ally must be within range of a spell for the redirect to occur.
If your ally is within range of the caster but you are not, the spell targets your ally normally.
Should you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.
