You speak up to five words, which are magically amplified to be heard by all hearing creatures within half a mile.
All within the area hear the words as loud as you spoke them.
The spell does not harm people who hear it and cannot transmit magical effects (such as a harpy's song, sonic spells, or charm effects), although a creature already affected by a magical effect (such as a suggestion) could respond to a nonmagical trigger word deployed by a warning shout.
Anyone sleeping naturally (as opposed to magically induced sleep, such as from a sleep spell) within the area is woken by the warning shout.
