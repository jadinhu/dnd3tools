 <b>Level:</b>   Domination 9,   
<b>Components:</b>V, S, <abbr title="Experience">XP, 
 <b>Duration:</b> Permanent

 	
As dominate monster (see page 224 of the Player's Handbook), except the subject is permanently dominated if it fails its initial Will save.
A subject ordered to take an action against its nature receives a Will save with a -4 penalty to resist taking that particular action.
If the save succeeds, the subject still remains your thrall despite its minor mutiny.
Once a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty.
XP Cost: 500 XP per Hit Die or level of the subject.
