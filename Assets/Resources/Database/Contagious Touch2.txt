Upon casting this spell, you must choose one disease from this list: blinding sickness, cackle fever, filth fever, mindfire, red ache, the shakes, or slimy doom (see Disease in Chapter 3 of the <span class="caps">DUNGEON</span> MASTER'S Guide for descriptions).
Any living creature you hit with a melee touch attack during the spell's duration is affected as though by the contagion spell, immediately contracting the disease you have selected unless it makes a successful Fortitude save.
You cannot infect more than one creature per round.
