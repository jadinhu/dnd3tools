This spell creates a black storm cloud that hovers over your enemies, striking them with a terrifying combination of effects from the Elemental Planes.
When created, the storm of elemental fury buffets the area immediately below it with a whirling windstorm that functions as described on pages 94-95 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible, and Small or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blown away.
Medium creatures must make their Fortitude save or be knocked prone, and Large or larger creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save to move that round.
Flying creatures that fail their saves are instead blown in a random direction, traveling 1d6x;5 feet of Large or larger, 1d6x;10 feet if Medium, and 2d6x;10 feet if Small or smaller.
Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to
the storm of elemental fury's save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.
If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends.
If you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects in each following round, as noted below.
Each effect occurs during your turn.
As a move action (taken in addition to the standard action required to maintain concentration), you can move the storm cloud up to 40 feet in any direction.
2nd round: Chunks of rock fall from the sky, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save).
3rd round: A deluge of rain extinguishes unprotected flames and perhaps protected ones as well (50% chance).
The torrential downpour reduces visibility to 5 feet and cuts movement speed in half.
4th round: Flame pelts the area underneath the storm cloud, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (Reflex half).
