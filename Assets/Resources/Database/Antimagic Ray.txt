An invisible ray projects from your fingers.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.
The target, if struck, functions as if it were inside an antimagic field.
If this spell is used against a creature, the target can't cast spells or can't use supernatural or spell-like abilities, nor do such abilities have any effect on the creature.
However, the creature can still use spell completion items (such as scrolls) or spell trigger items (such as wands), even though it can't cast the spells required.
If this spell is used against an object, that object's magical powers are suppressed ï¿½ ;including any spells previously cast and currently in effect on the item, as well as any spells or magical effects targeted on the object during the antimagic ray's duration.
Remember that an object struck by the ray only receives a saving throw if it is attended or if it is a magic item.
An unattended item, even if currently under the effect of a spell (such as a torch with continual flame cast upon it), receives no save.
The spell doesn't affect any objects other than the target itself, even if those objects are worn, carried by, or in contact with the target.
For instance, if a creature is the target, its equipment remains unaffected.
Material Component: A pinch of iron filings mixed with ruby dust worth 100 gp.
