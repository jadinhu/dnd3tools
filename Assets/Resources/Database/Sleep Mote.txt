You create a dust devil composed of slumber-inducing particles.
It flies at a speed of 30 feet per round (perfect maneuverability), and you can concentrate on controlling its every movement or specify a simple program.
Directing the vortex's movement is a move action, while changing its programmed movement is a standard action.
If you don't move or program the vortex, it merely stays at rest, spinning and howling.
The vortex dissipates if it exceeds the spell's range.
If the sleep mote enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and causes a magical slumber to come upon any creature whose space it completely engulfs that fails a Will saving throw (thus, creatures larger than Medium size have immunity to a sleep mote).
Even on a successful Will saving throw, affected creatures are sleepy, and take a -2 penalty on all Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma checks for the spell's duration.
Sleeping creatures are helpless.
Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).
Sleep mote has no effect on unconscious creatures.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of fine sand and a live cricket.
