The warded creature gains partial protection against positive energy effects.
Subtract 10 from the hit point damage dealt by any positive energy effect (such as cure spells) that affects the warded creature.
Positive energy effects that wouldn't deal hit point damage to the target (such as turning attempts) affect the target normally.
