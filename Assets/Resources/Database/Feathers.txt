This spell functions like polymorph other, except that you polymorph each subject into a feathered animal of Small size or smaller (your choice of species, but all subjects take the same form).
Any subject may choose to resume his or her normal form (as a full-round action); doing so ends the spell for that individual alone.
Otherwise, all subjects remain in the bird form until the spell expires or you dismiss it, restoring all affected creatures to normal form.
