Rings of blue-white energy travel from your feet to your head and back again, vanishing after encircling you in their glow.
This spell calls upon the raw natural forces within you to grant the basic instincts possessed by your ancestors.
You gain a +5 competence bonus on initiative and Survival checks.
If primal instinct is active on you at the same time as primal hunter, primal senses, or primal speed, you gain uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature).
It all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you gain improved uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature; your barbarian level for the purpose of being flanked equals your caster level).
Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), you also gain a +5 competence bonus on any one kind of Knowledge check, chosen when you cast primal instinct,
and you are treated as trained in that skill.
