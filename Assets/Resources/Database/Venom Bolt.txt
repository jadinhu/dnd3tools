You release a beam of fell energy from your eye, mouth, fingertip, or tail tip that travels in a straight line.
Every creature in its path takes 2d8 points of acid damage, though the beam is not actually composed of any acidic substance.
A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
Furthermore, every creature in the path of the venom bolt must also make a successful Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds.
Success means the subject is slowed for 1 round.
Creatures do not block the beam, but walls and other solid barriers do.
Yuan-ti and their creations (such as tainted ones and broodguards) are immune to the effects of this spell, as are creatures with the Snake Blood feat (see Feats in <span class="caps">FORGOTTEN</span> <span class="caps">REALMS</span> Campaign Setting).
Other Scaled Ones are immune to the paralysis effect and need not save against it.
Material Component: A drop of venom from any sort of poisonous snake.
