When you cast this spell, you create a drifting &quot;lightning rod&quot; of incarnum that appears at the point you designate within range.
Instantly, an arc of soul energy forms between you and the incarnum rod, creating a line.
At the end of your turn, any living creature in that line takes 1d6 points of damage (Reflex negates).
In subsequent rounds, incarnum arcs again between you and the rod at the end of your turn.
You can move the rod up to 20 feet by an act of will as a move action, or you can leave it in place and move yourself if you wish to change the path of the arc.
If the distance between you and the rod at the end of your turn is beyond the spell's range, no arc occurs but the spell remains active.
Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in this spell increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points (2d6 points for 1 point of essentia, 3d6 points for 2 points of essentia, and so on).
Material Component: A small brass rod.
