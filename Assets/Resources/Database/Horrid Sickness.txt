Your victim's eyes water and her flesh pales as a wave of sickness washes over her.
Waves of pain and sickness wrack the subjects, rendering themnauseated.
A successful Fortitude save negates this effect.
If a subject fails the initial Fortitude save, she can attempt a Fortitude save as a move action each round on her turn; success indicates that she is instead sickened for the duration of the spell.
