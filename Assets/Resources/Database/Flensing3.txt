<b>With a cruel utterance, you complete the spell an unleash its terrible energy. A sickeningly wet ripping sound accompanies the sight of strips of flesh being torn away, as if some invisible hand was attempting to peel your target like an onion.</b>
	
When you cast this spell, you literally strip the flesh from a corporeal creature's body, inflicting incredible pain and psychological trauma. Each round, the subject takes 2d6 points of damage, and 1d6 points of Charisma. A successful Fortitude save negates the ability damage and reduces the hit point damage by half for that round, but does not end the spell.
