This spell, favored by the Daggerspell Guardians (see page 167), improves your ability to defend yourself when wielding a pair of daggers.
The spell, like many of the daggerspell techniques, depends on the use of daggers to bring down a foe.
The spell's effect cannot be realized unless you are wielding two daggers, but the spell does not end if you drop, throw, or otherwise lose a hold on one or both of your daggers.
While this spell is in effect, if you make a full attack while holding a dagger in each hand, you gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made with daggers in that round.
The magical energy that permeates your daggers while this spell is active allows you to deflect the magical energy of many spells.
When wielding two daggers and fighting defensively, you gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your caster level.
The spell focuses your concentration so that when you devote all of your attention to defense, you can turn the
force of most blows away from your body with your daggers.
When wielding two daggers and using the total defense action, you gain both the spell resistance benefit described above and damage reduction 5/magic.
Focus: A pair of daggers.
