You create a glowing mace of force that appears in your hand.
When used against a creature, you must make a melee touch attack against the target.
If it hits, the mace of Odo deals 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
Undead creatures take an additional +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +10).
A creature struck by the mace must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round.
While you are holding the mace, if you are targeted with a spell, you may choose to have the mace absorb that spell.
The mace occupies your hand but (unlike holding the charge for a touch spell) does not disappear if you cast another spell.
When the mace strikes a creature, is used to absorb a spell, or is removed from your grasp, it vanishes.
The point in space where it vanished from glows as a light spell for the remainder of the duration.
