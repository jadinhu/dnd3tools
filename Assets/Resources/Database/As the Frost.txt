With a crystalline tinkling, your body transforms into a figure of ice and cold, your equipment melding into your new form.
Your skin becomes brilliant blue and transparent, with glimpses of liquid beneath.
Frost forms across your hands and arms, dripping down to form knifelike icicles.
Your breath hisses white in the bitterly cold air surrounding you.
Snow swirls about you as your presence freezes the air's moisture.
Ice crystals spread from your footprints.
Your creature type changes to outsider.
Unlike other outsiders, you can be brought back to life if you die in this form.
You gain the following qualities and abilities:			Immunity to cold.		Damage reduction 10/magic and piercing.		At the beginning of your action, creatures within 15 feet of you take 2d6 points of cold damage per round.	
A creature that takes damage from this effect must make a Fortitude save (DC 17 + your key ability modifier) or be slowed, as the slow spell, for the remaining duration of as the frost.
Spell resistance applies to this effect.
Material Component: A chunk of ice or crystal.
