You cause ordinary shadows to fly toward the creatures in the area, forming dark nets that cover and enfold the target or targets.
The net does not hamper movement, but a creature enfolded in a net cannot see beyond 5 feet, even with darkvision.
The folds of a net hide the creature within it, giving the creature nine-tenths concealment (attacks suffer a 40% miss chance).
The net also hampers the enfolded subject's own attacks, granting nine-tenths concealment to creatures within 5 feet and total concealment to creatures more than 5 feet away.
