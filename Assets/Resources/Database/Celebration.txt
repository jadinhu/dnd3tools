You cause any creatures in the area to feel increasingly more intoxicated the longer you perform a drinking song.
You must perform for at least 1 full round to produce the
first effects of the celebration spell.
After that, each full round you perform increases the subject's intoxication, as described in the table below.
A subject does not need to remain within the area, but those entering the area after the casting of the spell are not affected.
Your targets receive only one saving throw at the onset of the spell.
The effects last for the duration of your performance.
If you stop performing, the effects do not worsen and fade after 1 round per caster level.
