You must cast this spell outdoors, in a place where clouds are visible.
It calls forth a spirit of elemental air, binds it to a nearby cloud (either a normal cloud or storm cloud), and gives it a dragonlike form.
Upon forming, the dragon-shaped cloud swoops toward you, arriving in 1 minute regardless of the actual distance from you.
(The time it takes to reach you counts toward the spell's duration).
Once it arrives, you can command the dragon cloud like a summoned creature (see the summon nature's ally I spell in the Player's Handbook for details).
The dragon cloud speaks Auran.
At the end of the spell's duration, the dragon cloud evaporates into nothingness as the bound elemental spirit returns to its home plane.
The dragon cloud cannot pass through liquids or solid objects.
Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Constitution damage.
