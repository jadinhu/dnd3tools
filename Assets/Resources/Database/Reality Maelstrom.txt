You tear a temporary hole in reality itself that sucks all loose material and living creatures into it, sending them to a random plane (see sidebar).
Everything sucked into the reality maelstrom goes to the same plane.
Reality maelstrom has a primary and secondary area of effect.
The primary area is the hole itself: a sphere with a 5-foot radius per level of the caster.
Within that area, all unattended objects weighing 100 pounds or less are sucked into the reality maelstrom, as are all individuals who fail a Will saving throw.
The rip also creates a windstorm of air rushing into the tear.
All unattended objects weighing 50 pounds or less within a 10-foot radius per level of the caster are drawn into the primary area of effect of the reality maelstrom.
Individuals within the secondary area of effect must make a Reflex saving throw.
Those who fail are sucked into the primary area of effect and must make a Will saving throw to avoid being drawn into the maelstrom.
Individuals who make either saving throw may move and attack as normal but must make additional saving throws every round they remain within the primary or secondary areas of effect.
A reality maelstrom is a one-way portal, so nothing ever emerges from the hole the spell makes.
Material Component: A golden hoop no less than 1 inch across.
