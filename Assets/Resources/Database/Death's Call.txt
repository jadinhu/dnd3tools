You release a scream that chills the air with deathly energy.
All living creatures within the area (other than you) take 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum 5) and become fatigued.
A successful Fortitude save negates the fatigue.
Any swarm in the area of death's call instead takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d4) and becomes fatigued (Fortitude save negates fatigue).
This supersedes the normal +50% damage dealt to a swarm by an area spell.
