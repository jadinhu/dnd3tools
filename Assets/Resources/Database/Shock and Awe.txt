<b>Upon completing this spell, you feel a nagging compulsion to divert your attention from your enemies. Shaking off the feeling, you note with satisfaction that your targeted enemies seem even more distracted than you.</b>
	
This spell distracts its targets, preventing them from reacting with the deftness they might otherwise possess. Only effective when cast in the surprise round of combat and against flat-footed creatures, this spell causes those it affects to take a -10 penalty on their next initiative check. Targets that cannot be caught flat-footed (such as a rogue with uncanny dodge) cannot be affected by this spell.
