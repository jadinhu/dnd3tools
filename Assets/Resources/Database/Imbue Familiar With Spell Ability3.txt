You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the ability to cast them, to your familiar.
If you are a sorcerer, you imbue your familiar with spells you know how to cast.
You can imbue a maximum of one spell per three levels.
The maximum level of the spells to be imbued is one-third of your level, rounded down (maximum5th level).
Multiple castings of the spell do not increase these limits.
The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and so on) function according to your level.
Once you cast imbue familiar with spell ability on your familiar, you cannot prepare a new 6th-level spell to replace it until the familiar uses the transferred spells or is slain.
(If you are a sorcerer, you simply cannot cast imbue familiar with spell ability again until the familiar uses the imbued spells).
In either case, the spell slots you transfer are not available to you until the familiar uses them.
If the transferred spells require focuses or material components, the familiar must have them to use the spells.
Any XP costs from a transferred spell are deducted from your total when the familiar casts the spell.
