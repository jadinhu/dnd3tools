You create a whirling vortex of sand.
It flies at speed of 60 feet per round (perfect maneuverability), and you can concentrate on controlling its every movement or specify a simple program.
Directing the vortex's movement is a move action, while changing its programmed movement is a standard action.
If you don't move or program the vortex, it merely stays at rest, spinning and howling.
The vortex dissipates if it exceeds the spell's range.
If a storm mote enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d8 points of damage to the creature.
A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half.
Those outside the vortex have concealment against those inside.
The vortex extinguishes all nonmagical flame.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of sand.
