This spell transforms a mass of normal sand of any depth into solid glass permanently.
Any creature in the sand is allowed a Reflex save to escape before the area is hardened to glass.
Creatures unable to escape the area become trapped and must be broken out.
A creature so caught can break free by making a Strength check to break the glass or by dealing damage to the glass.
Glass has hardness 1, 1 hit point per inch of thickness, and a break DC of 12, +1 per inch of thickness.
A creature partially caught in the glass takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity, and is unable to move.
When breaking glass, a creature takes 1d6 points of damage each time it makes a successful Strength check to break free.
If broken free by others, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage from broken glass.
A creature trapped beneath the surface of the glass may begin to suffocate (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Arcane Material Component: A mixture of crushed glass and sand.
