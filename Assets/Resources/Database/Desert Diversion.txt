A gray ray flecked with red springs from your outstretched hand.
You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target.
A target struck is covered with a glittering red field that usurps some forms of planar travel.
Forms of travel taken over by desert diversion include dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, greater teleport,
plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, teleport object, teleportation circle, and similar spells and spell-like abilities.
If the subject of desert diversion casts one of the above spells, he and those traveling with him (or anyone using the gate or teleportation circle) are diverted.
This spell can also be cast upon a gate or teleportation circle,
thereafter diverting all who use the affected spell for the duration of desert diversion.
Subjects are diverted to a wasteland location, chosen by the caster or randomly determined.
Until desert diversion ends or is dispelled, the subjects of the spell cannot use any of the abovementioned spells to travel from the area.
If they try, the casting simply returns them to the same spot in the middle of the waste.
When the duration expires, the diversion ends, and subjects return to their point of origin.
