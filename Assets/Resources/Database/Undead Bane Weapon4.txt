You give a weapon the undead bane special ability in addition to any other magical or mundane properties it has.
Against undead, your weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) is +2 higher than normal, and it deals +2d6 points of bonus damage.
The spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon that already has the undead bane special ability.
If you are caster level 9th (paladin level 18th) or above, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus if it is not already a magic weapon.
Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets with this spell.
These projectiles must be of the same type, and they must be together (in the same quiver, piled in the same spot, or the like).
Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose this effect after an attack has been made with them.
A weapon affected by this spell is considered good-aligned, so it has special effects on certain creatures.
Any weapon affected by this spell glows with a serene gray radiance that sheds as much light as a candle.
