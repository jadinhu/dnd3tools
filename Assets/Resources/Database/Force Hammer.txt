<b>Force hammer</b> is designed to bring down a single opponent without causing lasting harm. You fire a ray of force at a single target, making a ranged touch attack. If you hit, the bolt deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per level (maximum 10d4). If the target fails a Fortitude save, it is dazed for one round. (A successful saving throw does not reduce the damage.) <b>Force hammer</b> has no effect on nonliving creatures or objects. Creatures that are immune to nonlethal damage cannot be dazed by the spell.
