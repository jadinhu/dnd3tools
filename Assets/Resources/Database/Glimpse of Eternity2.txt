<b>Glimpse of Eternity</b>(Magic of Eberron, p. 96)

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
 <b>Level:</b>  Bard 5,  Sorcerer 5,  Wizard 5,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, M, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
 <b>Target:</b> One creature
 <b>Duration:</b> 1 round/3 levels
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Will partial; see text
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes

 	
You call upon the ancestral memory and experience of the long-lived elves, visiting all the burden of that knowledge on a single creature. The target of the spell takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and is confused for the duration of the spell unless it makes a Will save. A successful save results in half damage and negates the confusion.
	
Elves and similarly long-lived creatures are affected normally by this spell. No creature can experience millennia of knowledge in such a short time without feeling its weight.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A pinch of dust from an hourglass.
