You disguise the wounds of a ghost who has a disturbing, repulsive, or gruesome appearance, making it appear completely normal (although still a ghost).
The spell does not change the ghost's features or disguise it in any way; it conceals the manner of the ghost's death so that it can walk about in polite society.
