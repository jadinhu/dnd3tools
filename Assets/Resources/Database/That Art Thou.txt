You extend your senses to become one with all beings and objects within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on you.
You see and feel everything sensed by every person, creature, and object in that area.
The onrush of sensory information gives you a +20 bonus on your Search, Spot, and Listen checks for the duration of the spell.
In addition, you are never considered flat-footed while the spell duration lasts, and you cannot be flanked unless every other creature within 30 feet of you is also flanked.
