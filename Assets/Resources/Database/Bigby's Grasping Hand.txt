This spell functions like Bigby's interposing hand, except the hand can also grapple one opponent that you select.
The grasping hand gets one grapple attack per round.
Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for wizards, clerics, and sorcerers, respectively), +10 for the hand's Strength score (31), -1 for being Large.
Its grapple bonus is this same figure, except with a +4 modifier for being Large instead of -1.
The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples.
Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.
The grasping hand can also bull rush an opponent as Bigby's forceful hand does, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check (+10 for Strength 35, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets), or interpose itself as Bigby's interposing hand does.
Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities ï¿½ ;Kord's grasping hand, for example.
Arcane Focus: A leather glove.
