The touched creature dies painlessly.
Instead of passing immediately beyond the Veil of Souls, the creature's soul remains on the Ethereal Plane and attempts to enter the Material Plane as a ghost.
Normally, this is used by ghost characters with a special nonhumanoid companion (such as a mage's familiar, a druid or ranger's animal companion, or a paladin's special mount) to allow the companion to travel with them in ghost form.
When the spell expires, the ghost creature dies the true death and its soul passes beyond the Veil of Souls.
It can be raised or resurrected before the spell duration expires, of course.
