You create an immobile zone of warding that is permeable to those of your religion but repels all others.
The warded area has a shimmering visible border, above which is a ghostly image of a giant hand (the appearance of the hand depends upon your patron, so Torm's clerics have a shining metal gauntlet, while those of Bane have a black clawed metal gauntlet and those of Malar have a great beast's claw).
Creatures that have the same patron as you, or are wearing a holy symbol of your patron, can enter and move within the warded area unhindered.
Other creatures that try to enter or move within the area must make Fortitude saves or be stunned for 1 round.
If a creature's only action is to try to move completely out of the area, the ward does not hinder it.
Clerics and paladins of deities other than Torm name this spell after their own deity ï¿½ ;hand of Ilmater, for example.
This spell has the alignment components of your patron, so if your patron is Torm, this is a lawful and good spell.
