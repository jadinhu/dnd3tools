You transform one of your hands into a mighty fist of living stone, gaining a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength for purposes of attacks, grapple checks, or breaking and crushing items.
In addition, you gain the ability to make one natural slam attack as a standard action, dealing 1d6 points of damage plus your new Strength bonus (or 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus if you make no other attacks that round).
You can make the slam attack as a natural secondary attack with the normal -5 penalty (or -2 penalty if you have the Multiattack feat; see page 304 of the Monster Manual) as part of a full attack action.
However, you cannot gain more than one slam attack per round with this spell due to a high base attack bonus (+6 or higher).
Your fist undergoes no change in size or form, remaining as flexible and responsive as it would normally be while under the spell's effect.
Material Component: A pebble inscribed with a stylized fist design.
