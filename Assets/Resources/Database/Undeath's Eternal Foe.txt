You grant one or more creatures special abilities that allow them to effectively destroy undead.
All subjects receive negative energy protection, except that their roll to resist a negative energy attack has a +10 sacred bonus.
The subjects are also immune to special attacks by undead that involve ability damage, ability drain, disease or poison.
Subjects can make melee and ranged attacks against ethereal or incorporeal undead as if they were using ghost touch weapons.
They also gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by undead.
