Silvery tendrils erupt from your outstretched arms and strike the creatures you choose.
A lingering silvery aura engulfs them thereafter.
Energy vulnerability can affect a number of creatures with total Hit Dice equal to twice your caster level or lower.
You select which creatures are affected.
When you cast this spell, specify an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic).
The affected creatures gain vulnerability to that energy type (they take +50% damage from that energy, even on a successful save).
Arcane Material Component: A tiny wooden shield, which the caster snaps in half.
