You fill an area with illusory black, creeping mist that vaguely resembles thousands of slender grasping tentacles.
You and one creature you touch are immune to the effects of this spell and can see through it without difficulty.
When you cast the spell, you decide if the effect remains stationary or moves away from you at a rate of 10 feet per round.
The mist obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment (attacks suffer a 20% miss chance).
Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).
A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the doomtide in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 1 round.
Furthermore, creatures within its area must make Will saves or be dazed for as long as they remain in the cloud.
The spell does not function underwater.
