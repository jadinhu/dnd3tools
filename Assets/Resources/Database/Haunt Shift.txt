Haunt shift translates corporeal and incorporeal undead into haunting presences (see page 6).
The spell converts 1d4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4).
Undead creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those that are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first.
No creature of 9 or more HD can be affected, and Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
Material Component: A pinch of powdered skull.
