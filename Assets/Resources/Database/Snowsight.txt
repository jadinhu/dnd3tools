The subject gains the ability to see to the normal limits of its vision even in whiteout conditions, and ignores all penalties due to snow glare and snow blindness.
Snowsight is no better than normal vision.
During daylight, this usually means the subject can see to the horizon; at night, vision is restricted to ambient light or darkvision as appropriate for the subject creature.
Snowsight does not grant creatures the ability to see in darkness.
