When you chant the final words of your incantation, a soft, comforting voice seems to whisper in your ear, &quot;What knowledge may I impart to you?&quot;
Spiritual advisor allows you to consult with a spirit, an angel, or some other divine aspect of your deity.
This advisor manifests as a barely shimmering orb that floats above one of your shoulders.
When it speaks, only you can hear its counsel.
As long as the spiritual advisor is present, it helps you recall bits of trivia, history, or other knowledge.
This knowledge can be as general or specific as is required, and the information gained grants you a +4 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks while the spell is in effect.
You can even attempt checks with Knowledge skills in which you have no skill ranks or retry a Knowledge check you failed before casting the spell.
