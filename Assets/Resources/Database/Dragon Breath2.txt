You gain a breath weapon resembling that of a dragon.
When you cast this spell, you choose both the shape and energy type of the breath weapon, from the following options: line (acid, electricity, or fire) or cone (acid, cold, or fire).
A line is 5 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 60 feet long, while a cone is 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 30 feet wide.
Once you make the selection of shape and energy type, it is fixed for the duration of the spell.
Using your breath weapon is a standard action.
The breath weapon deals 3d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every two levels above 5th (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level).
Targets in the area may attempt a Reflex save for half damage.
You can use this breath weapon up to three times during the spell's duration (plus one additional use per two levels above 5th).
After using this breath weapon, you can't use it again for 1d4+1 rounds.
(Using this breath weapon has no effect on your ability to use other breath weapons you might have, and vice versa).
You can't have more than one dragon breath spell active at the same time.
Even though using your breath weapon poses no danger to you, you don't gain any resistance or immunity to the energy type of the weapon.
Special: Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.
