<b>With a few short words of power, you draw the light from the surrounding area. Within just a few seconds, the light dims to utter darkness.</b>
	
You create an area of total darkness.
The darkness is impenetrable to no rmalvision and darkvision, but you can see normally within the blacklit area. Creatures outside the spell's area, even you, cannot see through it. You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless you cast it cast on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance.
	
Blacklight counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, such as daylight.
	
Material Component: A piece of coal and the dried eyeball of any creature.
