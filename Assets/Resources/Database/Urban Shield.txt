The city itself shields you from harm, leaning in to protect you with its walls, lampposts, and other structures.
You gain cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) against all attacks and spells.
At the same time, the city reshapes itself to accommodate your attacks.
Against your attacks and spells, enemies within the city never benefit from cover that would be gained from the walls, objects, or other parts of the city and its structures.
You must be within a community no smaller than a small city to cast this spell.
Material Component: A chip of stone or brick.
