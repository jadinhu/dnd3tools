A swarm of shimmering motes streams from your fingers and engulfs your target.
You create a swarm of faintly luminous motes of pure force that engulf one creature, obscuring its vision.
If the target relies on sight, all its attacks have a 20% miss chance while the motes last.
The motes also deal 1d6 points of damage each round.
The target can attempt a Reflex save each round to avoid the damage.
If a subject under the effects of luminous swarm is targeted by fever dream (page 104), the two spells interact to create a greater effect.
See the fever dream spell for details.
