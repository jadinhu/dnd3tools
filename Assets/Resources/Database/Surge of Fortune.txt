The power of your deity flows through you, guiding your movements and honing your instincts.
Upon casting this spell, you gain a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and spell penetration checks, as well as to Armor Class.
At any point before the spell expires, you can channel some of its remaining power into a single instant of perfect fortune as an immediate action.
The result of the next attack roll, saving throw, skill check, ability check, or spell penetration check you attempt is treated as a natural 20, as long as it occurs within 1 round of the time you invoked this power.
(If you use it for an attack roll, you must still roll to confirm the critical hit normally).
Using this option instantly ends the spell.
