By touching a nearby source of water � ;a standing pool, a stream, or even a portion of a larger body of water � ;you can perceive creatures and objects in contact with the water.
You can concentrate to focus flowsight on a given creature.
You retain your full visual acuity, including any magical effects, as well as any auditory enhancements you might have.
This action makes the subject potentially aware of the magical scrying; on a Will save, it prevents you from learning more about it, and you cannot try again on that subject for 24 hours.
However, you can turn your consciousness to another subject in contacted with the water and make a new scrying attempt each round.
Arcane Material Component: A piece of limestone.
