A magical shard of ice springs from your hand and speeds to its target.
You must succeed at a normal ranged attack to hit.
For every two caster levels, you gain a +2 bonus on the ranged attack roll.
The shard deals 1d8 points of piercing damage, plus 1d8 points of cold damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage.
(Creatures that are immune to cold damage take no Dexterity damage).
A successful Fortitude save reduces the cold damage by half and negates the Dexterity damage.
A miss creates a shower of ice crystals in a 10-foot-radius burst centered where the shard lands (see Grenadelike Weapon Attacks in the Player's Handbook).
The icy burst deals 1d8 points of splash damage.
A creature within the burst area can make a Reflex save to take half damage.
Material Component: A drop of water or piece of ice.
