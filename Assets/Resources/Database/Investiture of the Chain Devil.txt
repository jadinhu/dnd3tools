With a rush of red light and the faint clanking of many chains, you invest the target with the power of a chain devil.
While under the effect of this spell, the target is infused with the magical energies and malignant will of a chain devil.
While the spell is in effect, the subject's reach increases by 5 feet, and the subject's maximum number of attacks of opportunity made each round increases by one.
In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the chain devil).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.
Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.
