You surround a creature in a nimbus of emerald light that seems to draw missiles toward it.
The subject is cursed so that missile weapons veer toward him and strike with extreme force.
The subject takes a -5 penalty to Armor Class against any ranged attack, including projectile weapons, thrown weapons, and ranged touch attacks.
In addition, any critical threats on such attacks are automatically confirmed.
