Channeling hatred and spite, the caster calls upon dark power to give the subject a massive heart attack.
The subject suddenly drops to -8 hit points, then -9 hit points at the end of this round.
If someone immediately makes a successful Heal check (DC 15) or somehow gives the subject more hit points, she stabilizes.
Otherwise, at the end of the next round, the subject reaches -10 hit points and dies.
Drug Component: Baccaran.
