You manipulate the magical aura of a creature or object, creating a damaging feedback reaction of arcane power.
The target takes 1d6 points of damage per spell level of each functioning spell or spell-like ability currently affecting it (maximum 25d6).
For example, a creature who is hasted (3rd level), flying (3rd level), and protected by a stoneskin spell (4th-level wizard version) takes 10d6 points of damage (Will save for half ).
In addition, any creature that fails its save must then succeed on a Fortitude save or be dazed for 1d6 rounds.
Only spells specifically targeted on the creature in question can be used to create the backlash of a reciprocal gyre, so spells that affect an area (such as invisibility sphere and solid fog) can't be used to deal reciprocal damage to creatures within their area.
Likewise, persistent or continuous effects from magic items can't be used to deal reciprocal damage, but targeted spell effects can be ï¿½ ;for example, the magic of a cloak of resistance can't be used by reciprocal gyre, but a spell cast by a wand of invisibility could be.
