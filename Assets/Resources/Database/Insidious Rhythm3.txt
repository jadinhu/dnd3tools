The subject takes a ï¿½ ;4 penalty on Intelligence-based skill checks and Concentration checks due to an endlessly recycling melody stuck in its mind. Whenever the subject attempts to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check (DC equal to insidious rhythm's save DC + spell's level) or fail at the attempt.
