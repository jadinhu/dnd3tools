At one point during the duration of this spell, you can attempt to alter the outcome of a game of chance.
This spell can only affect nonmagical games, such as those using cards or dice.
It cannot affect a game involving magic, nor a magic item involved in a game of chance (such as a deck of many things).
Whenever a roll is made to determine the outcome of the game, a character under the effect of this spell may demand
a reroll and take the better of the two rolls.
For example, Darkon is playing a game that he has a 1 in 4 chance of winning.
The DM secretly rolls 1d4 and tells the player that Darkon lost.
Because Darkon is under the effect of a cheat spell, the player can have the DM reroll.
The spell alters probability, so there is no subterfuge that another character could notice (except for the casting of the spell itself ).
Focus: A pair of dice made from human bones.
