You sprout daggerlike spikes from all surfaces of your body and clothing.
The spikes appear metallic but are not actually metal, and never harm you or interfere with your movement or actions.
They allow you to deal 1d6 points of piercing damage (crit x2) with a successful grapple attack.
The spikes count as a martial weapon, and the spell grants proficiency with them.
You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case.
You inflict lethal damage when grappling.
If a creature grapples you, the spikes deal 2 points of damage to your attacker.
You get a +4 bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from a net, rope, grappler, or spell that entangles.
