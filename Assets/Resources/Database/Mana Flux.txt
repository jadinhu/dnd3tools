The air crackles and warps as you flood the area with unstable, disrupting magical energy.
The light shed by a continual flame torch flutters wildly, while your magic items hum and vibrate.
This spell creates a field of unstable magical energy.
Any creature trying to cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, activate a supernatural ability, or manifest a psionic power in the spell's area has a 20% chance of failure.
Spell completion items, such as scrolls, also have this failure chance.
If a creature within the spell's area has a spell failure chance due to some other source, such as wearing armor, check each source of spell failure chance separately.
Feats and abilities that reduce the chance of spell failure due to armor have no effect on this field.
A failed spell uses up a spell slot or other resources as appropriate.
Magic items do not have a chance of failure, since the power invested in them is too ingrained to be disrupted by this spell.
