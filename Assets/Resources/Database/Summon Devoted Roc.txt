This spell summons a particularly powerful roc.
It appears where you designate (assuming the space is large enough to hold a Gargantuan creature) and acts immediately, on your turn.
You may command the roc telepathically as a free action, allowing you to direct its actions as you desire.
The roc has normal statistics for a creature of its kind (see page 215 of the Monster Manual), with the addition of a +5 enhancement bonus on its attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.
Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
