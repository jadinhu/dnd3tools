Pyrotechnics turns a fire into either a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on the version you choose.
Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights.
This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).
These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected.
Spell resistance can prevent blindness.
Smoke Cloud: A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud.
The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level.
All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud.
All within the cloud take -4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates).
These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud.
Spell resistance does not apply.
Material Component: The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished.
A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished.
Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.
