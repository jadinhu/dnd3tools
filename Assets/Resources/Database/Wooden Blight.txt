The spirit of the trees manifests within your foe, slowing and transforming its body.
You transform the subject's body into wood from the inside out.
Each round, the subject must make a new saving throw or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage.
Success halves the Dexterity damage from that round and ends the spell.
A subject whose Dexterity is reduced to 0 or lower by this spell transforms, along with its gear, into a mindless, inert, wooden statue.
A creature in this state is not actually dead, but it does not register as alive either when viewed with spells such as deathwatch.
If the target already has Dexterity damage or a penalty to Dexterity, wooden blight is even more debilitating.
Each round in which the subject takes Dexterity damage from this spell, its base movement rate is reduced by 5 feet for every point of Dexterity damage it takes (minimum speed 5 feet).
Creatures of the plant type are immune to this spell.
Material Component: A sliver of wood from a living tree.
