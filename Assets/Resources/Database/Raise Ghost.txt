<b>Raise Ghost</b>(Ghostwalk)

Conjuration (Healing) [Ectomancy]

As raise dead, except that this spell can bring back only a ghost who has been killed.
It does not restore life to a dead body, but instead brings back a slain ghost as a ghost.
The spell requires some of the ghost's original ectoplasm (some of the ghost's ectoplasm that has been preserved with magic or alchemy is sufficient).
Alternatively, you may cast it on a dead creature's body to bring it back as a ghost.
The creature's soul is aware that it will return as a ghost instead of a living creature and can refuse to accept the spell if it does not want this to happen.
This form of the spell works only on creatures that can become ghosts.
As with other forms of this magic, if cast within the Manifest Ward, a raised ghost does not lose a level or a Constitution point when brought back from the dead.
