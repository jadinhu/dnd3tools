A waterball is a spherical burst of water that looks like a blue fireball.
As with a fireball, you point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the waterball is to burst.
A blue, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the waterball at that point.
(An early impact results in an early detonation).
If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as an arrow slit, you must &quot;hit&quot; the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
(See the fireball spell description in the Player's Handbook for details of the blast pattern).
When it detonates, the waterball deals 1d6 points of subdual damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
An affected creature can make a Reflex save for half damage.
Since the damage is subdual rather than energy, it is subject to damage resistance.
Objects take no damage unless they have a hardness of 0, in which case they take full damage.
If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the waterball may continue beyond it if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
Material Component: A full waterskin that you burst when casting the spell.
