You can control the actions of any humanoid that is Medium or smaller.
You establish a telepathic link with the subject's mind.
If a common language is shared, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of his abilities.
If no common language is shared, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here&quot;, &quot;Go there&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, and &quot;Stand still&quot;.
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from him.
Subjects have a chance of resisting this control (Will save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast).
Those affected by the spell and then forced to take actions against their nature receive a new saving throw with a penalty of -4.
Obviously self-destructive orders may be carried out, unless the subject can make a saving throw with the -4 penalty.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane.
You need not see the subject to control it.
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or dispel it.
