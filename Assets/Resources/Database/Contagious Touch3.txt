<b>Holding out your hand like it's dead, you croak out magic words and imbue your limb with a terrible disease.</b>
	
Upon casting this spell, you choose one disease from this list: blinding sickness, cackle fever, filth fever, mindfire, red ache, the shakes, or slimy doom (<b>DMG</b> 292). Any living creature you hit with a melee touch attack during the spell's duration is affected as though by the <b>contagion</b> spell, immediately contracting the disease you have selected unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. You cannot infect more than one creature per round.
