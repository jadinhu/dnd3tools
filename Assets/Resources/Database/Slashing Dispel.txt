You rip away the spell energy infused within a creature, turning it into a harmful burst of energy that burns into the creature before dissipating.
This spell functions like dispel magic (PH 223), except as noted here.
Any creature that has a spell effect removed from it takes 2 points of damage per level of the dispelled effect.
If a creature loses the effects of multiple spells, it takes damage for each one.
