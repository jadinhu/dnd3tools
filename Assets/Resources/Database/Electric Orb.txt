As <b>acid orb</b>, except electric orb deals electricity damage.
A creature struck directly takes the orb's damage, and the play of electricity leaves its metal accouterments magnetized for 1 round.
A creature wearing metal armor is effectively entangled and suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity.
If the surfaces surrounding the creature are metallic, it cannot move.
Otherwise, it moves at half speed and can't run or charge.
If the creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a Concentration check (DC 15) or lose the spell.
A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half and negates the magnetism.
