This spell conjures one instrument of the type the caster typically favors.
The quality of this summoned instrument can vary widely (roll 1d6): poor (1), average (2-5), or masterwork (6).
Only one instrument appears per casting, and it cannot be exchanged for another.
The caster can, however, reject the instrument simply by dismissing the spell.
This is a real instrument temporarily borrowed from elsewhere, not a figment or creation.
For that reason, it is considered good form to deposit a small fee inside the instrument before it returns whence it came.
