<b>Encircling your eye with thumb and forefinger as if holding a jeweler's lens, you speak the arcane words that complete the spell. Objects near you suddenly seem clearer, more in focus. You note blemishes and imperfections you had missed before.</b>
	
You gain an intuitive insight into the value of objects you come into contact with. You gain a +10 insight bonus on Appraise checks to determine the value of items you touch while this spell is in effect. Using the Appraise skill in this fashion requires 2 minutes instead of the normal 1 minute.
	
Even if you fail an Appraise check while this spell is in effect, you never mistakenly estimate the worth of an item by more than 50%.
