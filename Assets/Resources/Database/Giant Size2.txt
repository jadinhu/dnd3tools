When you cast this spell, your body assumes truly gigantic proportions.
The spell causes you to grow to Huge or larger size, depending on your caster level.
Your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, natural armor, and size modifier to AC and attacks all change based on your new size, as shown on the table below.
The only equipment that changes size with you is ordinary, mundane clothing, so you may not be able to use weapons or magic items effectively in your giant form.
Material Component: The scale of a dragon or hairs from the head of a giant.
