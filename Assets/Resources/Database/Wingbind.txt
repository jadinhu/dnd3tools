A web of force surrounds the target, entangling it like a net.
If the target fails its saving throw, it is entangled.
Perhaps most important, the creature cannot use wings to fly ï¿½ ;hence the common name of this spell.
A creature flying with wings falls immediately if it is entangled by wingbind.
An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape
Artist check against a DC equal to the saving throw DC of the spell.
Like a wall of force, the web of force is impervious to most attacks: It is immune to damage of all kinds, cannot be burst with a Strength check, and is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic.
Also like wall of force, the web is immediately destroyed by disintegrate, a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction.
