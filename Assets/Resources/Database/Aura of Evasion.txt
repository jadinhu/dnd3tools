You and all creatures within 10 feet of you gain evasion, but only against breath weapons.
(If a breath weapon would normally allow a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a creature within an aura of evasion that successfully saves takes no damage instead).
The effect of this spell doesn't stack with any existing evasion or improved evasion abilities.
Material Component: Powdered emerald worth 500 gp.
