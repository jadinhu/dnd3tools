At your touch, a dull rumble courses through the body of your foe, shaking apart his mind and body from within.
You make a touch attack to set up agonizing vibrations within the body of the target.
If you hit, the target is nauseated for the duration of the spell.
Each round on its turn it can attempt a Fortitude save to lessen this effect to sickened for that round.
A subject under the effect of painful echoes (page 112) takes 1 point of Constitution damage each time it fails a Fortitude save against resonating agony.
