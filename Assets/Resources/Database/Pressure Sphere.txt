This spell suddenly causes the water around a target to take on the terrible, bone-crushing pressure of the deepest ocean trenches.
This pressure deals 4d6 points of damage (Fortitude save for half).
The area of the spell can be constrained by the available water; it has no effect on creatures or objects that are within the radius but not in the water, or on squares of water that are not at least 5 feet deep.
The spell must be centered at or below the surface of the water.
