When you cast this spell, your skin toughens and shimmers as if covered with scales.
You gain a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.
This bonus increases to +3 at 3rd level, +4 at 6th level, and +5 at 12th level and up.
Since the AC bonus is a natural armor bonus, it does not stack with any natural armor you may already have.
Focus: A tattoo of a lizard on your skin.
