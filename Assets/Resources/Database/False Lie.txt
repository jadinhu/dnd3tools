Your subject takes on a shifty, dishonest demeanor.
False lie causes the subject to appear dishonest and deceptive.
Sense Motive checks made against the subject take a -10 penalty, and any failure convinces the observer that the subject is lying, even if she is not.
Anyone who casts a spell that reveals lies (such as discern lie)
can attempt a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level); if this fails, the spell registers the individual as lying even when she is not.
Material Component: A serpent's tongue.
