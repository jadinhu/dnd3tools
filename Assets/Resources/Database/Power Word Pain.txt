A word you speak causes continuing pain to your target.
	
You utter a single word of power that instantly deals 1d6 points of damage to one creature of your choice, and another 1d6 points in every round thereafter for as long as the spell lasts. The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total, as shown below. Any creature that currently has 101 or more hit points is unaffected by <b>power word pain</b>.
