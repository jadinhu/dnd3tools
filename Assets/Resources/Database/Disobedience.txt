A ghostly great helm that only you can see appears around your companion's head, warding her mind against control.
You shield your subject against mind-controlling spells and abilities.
Disobedience blocks any attempt to exercise mental control over the subject creature, including charm and compulsion effects that grant ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person or a vampire's dominate ability.
The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting a subject affected by disobedience, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of this spell.
If disobedience ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller becomes able to mentally command the targeted creature.
In addition to protecting the subject, disobedience sends false information to the creature that is attempting to gain control of the subject.
The would-be controller must succeed on a Will save or believe that its spell or ability has taken effect and that the target is now under its control.
The spell's subject becomes aware of commands issued by that creature and can choose to act however she pleases, disregarding the would-be controller's orders or going along with them in a pretense of obedience.
Material Component: A scrap of tin.
