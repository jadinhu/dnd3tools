You create a transparent ladder made of force.
The ladder is two feet wide and anywhere from 10 to 60 feet long, with rungs spaced 1 foot apart.
The ladder functions as a normal ladder.
Because it is a force object, it can block or be used as a weapon against incorporeal or ethereal creatures (although they normally can move through the walls or floor to go around the ladder if used as a barricade, and only creatures capable of wielding a 10-foot-long or larger weapon could use the ladder offensively against such a creature).
The ladder weighs 1 pound and can support 100 pounds of weight per caster level.
It can be destroyed by anything that destroys a wall of force.
Focus: A miniature silver ladder.
