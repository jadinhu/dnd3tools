This spell teleports you to the location of a specially prepared gem.
You initially cast gemjump upon a rogue stone (see the next chapter), which you must touch.
At any time after you prepare the stone you can utter a command word, and instantly teleport to the location of the gem, provided you and the stone are on the same plane.
The teleport is always on target (as though you are using a teleport without error spell).
If the area containing the gem is too small for you, you appear in the nearest sufficiently large space.
You can transport, in addition to yourself, objects and creatures weighing up to 50 pounds per caster level.
Thus, a 15th-level wizard could transport his person and objects or creatures weighing an additional 750 pounds.
Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.
An unwilling creature can't be teleported by gemjump.
Likewise, a creature's Will save (or spell resistance) prevents items in its possession from being teleported.
Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.
You can only have one gemjump spell cast on a particular rogue stone at a time, but any number of other wizards can use the same stone you're using.
Focus: A rogue stone.
