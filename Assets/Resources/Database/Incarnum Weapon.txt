An oversized weapon made of pure incarnum springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 2d6 points of damage per hit.
In addition, any living creature struck by the incarnum weapon takes 1 point of Wisdom drain (a successful Will save negates the Wisdom drain).
The weapon takes a form based on your alignment: battleaxe (chaotic), flail (evil), warhammer (good), or longsword (law).
Casters can choose any weapon whose alignment is not opposed to theirs (neutral casters can choose any of the four weapons).
Regardless of the weapon's form, it threatens a critical only on a 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit.
The incarnum weapon strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn.
It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus.
It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon; for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction.
The weapon always strikes from your direction.
It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.
Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon.
If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers.
Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target.
If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target.
On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack.
Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to.
An incarnum weapon cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but it can be affected by any effect that would affect a spell or a soulmeld.
An incarnum weapon's Armor Class against touch attacks is 11 (10 + size bonus for Small object).
Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in the incarnum weapon adds a +1 insight bonus on the weapon's attack rolls and damage rolls and expands the weapon's critical threat range by 1.
For example, an incarnum weapon spell with 2 points of essentia invested would have a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and would have a critical threat range of 18-20.
