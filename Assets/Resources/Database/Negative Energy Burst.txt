You release a silent burst of negative energy from a point you indicate.
The burst deals 1d8 points of damage to living creatures in the area +1 point per caster level (maximum 1d8+10).
A successful Will save reduces damage by half.
Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures them of a like amount of damage, rather than harming them.
