<b>You feel a dark, oppressive weight pressing against your mind. When you touch your target, the weight lifts. The creature you touched seems now to be battling with a similar oppression.</b>
	
When you cast this spell and touch a creature that is under the influence of a mind-affecting spell or ability, that creature immediately receives another saving throw against the effect's original DC to break free of the effect. If the spell or ability did not originally permit a saving throw, this spell has no effect.
