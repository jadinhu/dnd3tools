You toss a small golden die.
It rolls toward the creature you choose, then disappears in a tiny golden flash of light.
The subject of the spell becomes unusually lucky.
Once during the spell's duration, when he makes an attack roll, skill check, saving throw, or ability check, he rolls twice and takes the better result.
He must choose to use this ability before the check is attempted, and the spell expires once the second die is rolled.
Material Component: A gold die (worth 20 gp).
