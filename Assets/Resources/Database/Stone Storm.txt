<b>Thunderous grinding splits the air. A pounding storm of stones slams down, pulverizing all beneath it as razor-sharp fragments ricochet out in all directions.</b>
	
A blinding storm of bullet-sized stones pounds down for 1 round. All creatures in the area take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 3d6 points of slashing damage as the stones slam down, then shatter to razor-sharp shards (no save for either, but a creature's damage reducÂ­tion applies to this damage, which is treated as magic and bludgeoning and magic and slashing, respectively). A -4 penalty applies to Listen checks made within the stone storm's effect, and all land movement within its area is at one-quarter speed.
	
Material Component: A handful of obsidian pebbles.</p
