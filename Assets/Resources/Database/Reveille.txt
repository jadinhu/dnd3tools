You cause a recently dead creature (within three days of its death) to reveal information about events that led up to its death.
The corpse speaks tersely in its native language, using no more than a dozen words or so in a round.
In the first round, it describes the last thing it saw.
In the second, it describes its dying wish.
In the third, it describes the wounding that killed it.
In the fourth, it tells who killed it.
In the fifth, it tells why it believes it was killed.
In the sixth and all rounds following, it answers one question to the best of its ability (as speak with dead).
The corpse has no more knowledge than it had when alive, nor does it retain any memory of events that occurred after its death.
All restrictions placed on the use of speak with dead (differing alignments allow a saving throw, no repeat uses of this spell or speak with dead within seven days, intact body required, and undead creatures are immune) apply to this spell as well.
