You allow a creature to skate across any icy surface, either level or inclined, increasing its base land speed by 60 feet.
(This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus).
No Balance checks are required for this movement (even during combat on ice) unless the recipient attempts exceptional maneuvers, such as jumping a crevasse or gliding up a frozen waterfall, or takes damage ï¿½ ;even then, the recipient gains a +4 enhancement bonus on its Balance check.
