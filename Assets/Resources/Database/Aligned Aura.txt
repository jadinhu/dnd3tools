A rush of divine energy flows through your holy symbol, infusing your body with the essence of the divine ethos. When you cast this spell, choose one non-neutral aspect of your own alignment ï¿½ ;chaos, evil, good, or law. (If you are neutral, you can select whichever alignment you wish each time you cast this spell). You are immediately surrounded in a 20-foot aura of invisible energy associated with the chosen alignment component. Anyone in that area who shares that alignment component gains a bonus, and anyone with the opposed alignment component must make a Fortitude save or take a penalty. The values of these modifiers and the features to which they apply are given on the following table. These modifiers end when the affected creature leaves the spell's area.
	<table>		<tr>			<th>Alignment </th>			<th>Bonus </th>			<th>Penalty </th>		</tr>		<tr>			<td> Chaos </td>			<td> +1 on attack rolls </td>			<td> -1 on saving throws </td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td> Evil </td>			<td> +1 on damage rolls </td>			<td> -1 to Armor Class </td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td> Good </td>			<td> +1 on saving throws </td>			<td> -1 on attack rolls </td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td> Law </td>			<td> +1 to Armor Class </td>			<td> -1 on damage rolls </td>		</tr>	</table>	
At any point before the duration expires, you can choose to unleash the spell's remaining power in a 60-foot burst that deals 1d4 points of damage per round of duration remaining (maximum 15d4) to each creature of the opposed alignment in the area. Each affected creature can attempt a Fortitude save for half damage. The burst also heals 1 point of damage per round of duration remaining (maximum 15 points) for each creature of the same alignment in the area. Once this option is invoked, the spell ends immediately.
