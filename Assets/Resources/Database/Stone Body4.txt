<b>As the echoes of your spellcasting die, your flesh begins to stiffen and turn gray, gaining the rough texture and consistency of stone.</b>
	
This spell transforms your body into living stone, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities.
	
You gain damage reduction 10/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, extra damage from critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but you take a � ;4 penalty to Dexterity (minimum Dexterity 1). Your speed is reduced to one-half normal, and your weight increases by a factor of three.
