You create a number of loyal skeletons from fingerbones.
All skeletons are Medium-size, with the normal Monster Manual statistics for their kind, except that their effective Hit Dice as far as turning is concerned is equal to your caster level.
You can create one skeleton per caster level.
These skeletons count toward the number of Hit Dice of undead you can have in your control (2 HD worth per caster level, as with the animate dead spell).
Unlike the animate dead spell, these skeletons try to remain within 60 feet of you.
If this distance is exceeded, a skeleton becomes inert until you return to within 60 feet of it.
Material Component:One fingerbone from a Medium-size creature and one onyx gem worth 50 gp per skeleton to be created.
The skeleton that forms from the fingerbone is that type of creature.
