This spell functions like summon monster I (see page 285 of the Player's Handbook), except that you summon an undead creature.
Summon undead I conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list in the Summon Undead table at right.
You choose which creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.
Summoned undead do not count toward the total Hit Dice of undead that you can control with animate dead, plague of undead, or other command undead abilities.
No undead creature you summon can have more Hit Dice than your caster level +1.
Focus: A tiny bag, a small candle (not lit), and a carved bone from any humanoid.
Note: The descriptions of the summon undead spells presented here supersede earlier published descriptions.
