You gain the ability to perceive weak points in your opponent's armor.
Once per round, one of your melee or ranged attacks may disregard the target's armor, shield, and natural armor bonuses (including any enhancement bonuses) to Armor Class.
Other AC bonuses, such as dodge bonuses, deflection bonuses, and luck bonuses, still apply.
