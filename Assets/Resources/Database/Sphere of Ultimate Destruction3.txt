You conjure a featureless black sphere of nothingness that disintegrates almost anything it touches.
It flies at up to 30 feet per round and attacks the creature or object you indicate.
You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike a creature with the sphere.
The sphere stops moving for the round when you make an attack on a creature or object.
You must actively direct the sphere on your action to move it to a new target; this requires a move-equivalent action on your part.
The sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
If the sphere ends its movement in a square occupied by a creature or object, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be subject to a disintegrate effect.
If successful, the creature or object is only partially affected and takes 5d6 points of damage instead.
If the sphere is directed to strike an object or part of an object, it disintegrates the 5-foot cube it occupies.
The sphere may destroy one creature, object, or 5-foot cube of matter per round, provided it is directed to a suitable target.
The sphere of ultimate destruction counts as a disintegrate spell for the purpose of destroying a wall of force (or any other spell or effect specifically affected by a disintegrate spell).
Material Component: A pinch of dust from a disintegrated creature.
