This spell transforms a magic potion into a volatile substance that can be hurled out to the specified range.
The spell destroys the potion and releases a 10-foot-radius burst of energy at the point of impact.
The caster must specify the energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) when the spell is cast.
The potion deals 1d6 points of damage (of the appropriate energy type) per spell level of the potion (maximum 3d6).
For example, a potion of displacement transformed by this spell deals 3d6 points of damage.
An energized potion set to deal fire damage ignites combustibles within the spell's burst radius.
Material Component: A magic potion.
