You transform a pinecone into a devastating grenade. It functions as a splash weapon that can be hurled as far as 100 feet. A successful ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Upon impact, the pinecone detonates, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6) to its target. All other creatures within 20 feet take 1 point of splash (shrapnel) damage per die. A creature within this area that makes a successful Ref lex saving throw takes half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.
	
For a period of time equal to 10 minutes per level of the caster, the area of the blast (a 20-foot radius around the impact point) is covered in razorsharp shrapnel. Any creature moving on foot into or through this area moves at half speed and takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the area.
