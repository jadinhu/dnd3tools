As part of initiating this strike, you must make a successful melee attack against an enemy creature whose alignment has at least one component different from yours. This foe must pose a threat to you or your allies in some direct, immediate way. If your attack hits, you or an ally within 10 feet of you heals 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per initiator level (maximum +10).
