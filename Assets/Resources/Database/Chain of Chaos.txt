This powerful instrument of chaos spreads madness by touch.
The caster infects the first victim by making a successful melee touch attack.
A subject who fails a Will save is afflicted with insanity (a continuous confusion effect).
This condition is permanent until countered, and the madness can be passed to anyone the victim touches.
Anyone who makes the initial saving throw is immune to that casting of the chain of chaos spell.
Each person the subject touches during the spell's duration (including by successful melee attack) must make a Will save at the spell's DC or suffer the insanity effect.
Each additional victim in turn can pass the madness on for a period of one day per five caster levels after being infected.
The spell affects a maximum of five persons per caster level.
Individual victims can be restored by any means effective against insanity, for example, greater restoration, limited wish,
miracle, or wish.
Anyone restored cannot be affected again by that casting of the chain of chaos spell.
DM Note: When dealing with the effect of this spell on a large nonadventuring population over a period of time, it is not necessary to track each individual affected by this spell.
Instead, just decide if individuals encountered are mad and whether they are infectious based on your judgement of the progress of the chain madness.
