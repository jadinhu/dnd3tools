You limn your allies in a glowing nimbus, transforming their attacks into brilliant energy.
All persons affected by this aura give off light as a torch (20-foot radius).
Their weapon attacks (melee or ranged) function as if their weapons were brilliant energy weapons: They ignore nonliving matter and armor, and enhancement AC bonuses do not count against them.
The attacks cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects.
In addition, all attacks gain an enhancement bonus on damage equal to one-half the caster's level (maximum +10).
