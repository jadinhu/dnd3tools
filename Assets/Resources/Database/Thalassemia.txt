This spell thins the target creature's blood to little more than seawater, dealing 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6).
Only living creatures with a circulatory system and blood can be affected by this spell; it does not harm creatures immune to critical hits.
Creatures with the fire subtype instead take 1d8 points of damage per level.
