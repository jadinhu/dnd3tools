This spell taps into the planar energy of Mechanus to create a 6-inch-thick wall of moving iron cogs, wheels, gears, pistons, and assorted mechanical parts.
Each 5-foot square of the wall's surface has hardness 10 and 180 hit points.
Both sides of the wall have hundreds of moving parts that flail out, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per two caster levels (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within 10 feet.
A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
Material Component: A small gear.
