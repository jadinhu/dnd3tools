The subject's lungs fill with water if the subject fails a Fortitude saving throw.
To avoid drowning, the subject can hold his breath (see The Drowning Rule in Chapter 3 of the <span class="caps">DUNGEON</span> MASTER's Guide).
The subject gains a new save (to expel the water) every 2 rounds after the first.
While holding his breath with water-filled lungs, a character cannot talk or cast spells with verbal components, and he takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.
