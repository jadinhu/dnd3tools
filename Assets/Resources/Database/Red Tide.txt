<b>As you complete the spell, a surging, frothing wave of thick, red seawater washes over everything in the area.</b>
	
All creatures in the area of a red tide spell are immediately knocked prone and must make a Fortitude saving throw.
	
A creature that makes its Fortitude save against a red tide is sickened for 1 minute. A creature that fails this saving throw is nauseated for 1 minute, and it takes 2d6 points of Strength damage. After 1 minute, the nausea ends but the creature must make a second Fortitude saving throw or take an additional 2d6 points of Strength damage. Creatures that are immune to poison are immune to these effects of a red tide.
	
Creatures with the fire subtype take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half with a successful Reflex save.
	
The tainted water evoked by this spell vanishes almost immediately, and any objects or creatures in the area do not emerge wet.
