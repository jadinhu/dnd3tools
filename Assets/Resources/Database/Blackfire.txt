A ray of necromantic black energy springs from your hand, and on a successful ranged touch attack, a living target is engulfed in chill black flames that feed on the fuel of their victim's life force.
A creature engulfed in blackfire must make a successful Fortitude save each round that the spell is in effect or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated.
A creature that makes its save takes no damage for that round and is sickened instead.
In addition to its effects on the target, blackfire can spread rapidly, and any living creature adjacent to a creature engulfed in blackfire must succeed on a Reflex save or become engulfed itself.
Any creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 or lower by the spell is reduced to a pile of black ash, and can be returned to life only by true resurrection or wish, the caster of which must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check to restore the victim to life.
If a creature succeeds on its Fortitude save in 3 consecutive rounds, the blackfire affecting it gutters out.
The black flames cannot otherwise be extinguished by normal means (such as immersion in water or smothering), but an antimagic field, a successful dispel magic, a remove curse,
or a break enchantment spell snuffs it out.
As well, a creature protected by death ward has immunity to blackfire's effects.
Material Component: A pinch of dust from a vampire destroyed by sunlight.
