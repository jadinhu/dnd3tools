As polymorph other, except you polymorph up to one willing creature per level into a monstrous spider of any size from Tiny to Huge as you decide (see Appendix 2 in the Monster Manual).
All the creatures you transmute must become spiders of the same size.
The spell has no effect on unwilling creatures.
Subjects remain in the spider form until the spell expires or you dismiss the spell for all subjects.
In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume her normal form as a full-round action.
Doing so ends the spell for her and her alone.
Parts separated from the resulting spiders do not revert to their original forms, so the resulting spiders have poisonous bites.
Creatures polymorphed by spider shapes don't suffer the disorientation penalty that those transformed by polymorph other often do.
Subjects of spider shapes regain hit points as though they had rested for a day.
