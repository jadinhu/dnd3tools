The spell grants an enhancement bonus to Strength of 1d4+1 points, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier.
The spell ends instantly if you ever lose contact with the ground.
This means you cannot jump, tumble, charge, run, or move more than your speed in a round (because these acts cause both of your feet to leave the ground) without breaking the spell.
A natural stone wall or ceiling counts as the ground for the purpose of this spell (so you could climb a cavern wall and not lose the spell).
