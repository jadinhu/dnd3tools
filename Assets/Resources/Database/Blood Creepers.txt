Thorny vines burst from the creature's body, punching through bone, flesh, and skin to enwrap its arms and legs and tether it to the ground.
The subject takes 1 point of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 15) as the creepers rip apart its body.
In addition, the creepers entwine securely around it, trapping its legs and arms.
The subject is immobilized (unable to move from its current location) and entangled.
Each round, the subject takes an extra 1 point of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 15) unless it is able to escape.
A trapped creature can attempt to break free with a DC 20 Strength check or wriggle free with a DC 25 Escape Artist check, either of which ends the spell if successful.
Other creatures can use the aid another action as normal on these checks.
They can make attacks against these vines as if they were wooden objects with a thickness of 3 inches (see Smashing an Object, PH 185).
Despite its name, blood creepers is equally effective on living and nonliving creatures.
