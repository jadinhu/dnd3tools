You bring forth a swirling vortex of smoking lava intermixed with chunks of steaming ice.
A shower of lava globs and hailstones rains down for 1 round, dealing 6d6 points of cold damage and 6d6 points of fire damage to everything in the area.
The cylinder provides concealment similar to fog cloud and also applies a -4 penalty on Listen checks made within the area.
Movement costs within the area of the spell are doubled.
At the end of the duration, the lava and ice disappear, leaving no lingering effects (other than the damage dealt).
