With a crook of your finger and some spoken truenames, you urge a creature closer.
The creature's eyes turn solid blue as it shambles toward you.
This simple enchantment weaves truenames for &quot;approach&quot;
and &quot;closer&quot; into a spell that forces the subject to move closer to you.
If you succeed on the Truespeak check and the creature fails its saving throw, it must move at least 10 feet closer to you each round if able.
The creature can choose its own path and means of locomotion, but if it can, it must end its turn at least 10 feet closer to you than it started.
The creature defends itself normally and can take whatever actions it likes, so long as it moves closer to you every turn.
The creature can move toward you faster than 10 feet per round if it likes.
When the creature is adjacent to you, it acts normally unless you move away.
If you move away, it must move 10 feet per round closer to your new location if it can.
The beckon person spell lasts for at least 1 round, but it might last longer if you excel at the Truespeak check (described below).
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the truenames associated with movement and approach.
You learn these truenames when you learn this spell.
The Truespeak DC to cast this spell is 15; you add 2 rounds to the duration for every 5 points by which you exceed the DC.
