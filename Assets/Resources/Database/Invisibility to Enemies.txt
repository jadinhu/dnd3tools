As invisibility to spirits, but the warded creature is invisible to all creatures who may have hostile intentions against it.
Mindless creatures are not affected by the spell and can see the warded creature normally, since they are incapable of forming hostile intentions.
Animals and other creatures with Intelligence scores lower than 5 are also not affected, since their motivations are based on survival, not on hostile intent.
Focus: A white robe covered with handwritten symbols and verses.
