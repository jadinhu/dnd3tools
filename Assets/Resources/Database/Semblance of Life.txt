When this spell is cast, a solemn gray energy quickly settles on all undead creatures you target. This energy rapidly breaks apart the necromantic power that holds the undead together, dealing 3d6 points of damage to each target each round (no save).
	
In addition, intelligent undead creatures affected by the spell become briefly aware of the mockery of life they represent, and they might become temporarily overwhelmed by grief and pain over their condition. Such creatures are dazed for 1 round, but are allowed a Will save to negate this effect.
