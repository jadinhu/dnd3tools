When you cast this spell, you seize a silk scarf and lash it toward one creature within range.
You must have a line of sight to the target.
You make a ranged attack roll on the target as the scarf magically extends and becomes as hard as iron on impact.
If you hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +5).
Focus: A silk scarf.
