Using material from the Plane of Shadow, you can fashion a quasi-real weapon of any type you are proficient with.
This spectral weapon appears in your hand and behaves as a normal weapon of its type, with one exception: Any foe who makes a successful Will save recognizes its shadowy nature and thereafter takes only one-fifth normal damage from it.
The weapon has the ghost touch ability and is +1 for every 5 levels of the bard casting the spell.
You can maintain only one spectral weapon at a time, and only you can wield it.
The weapon dissipates when you let go of it or when the spell's duration expires, whichever comes first.
Focus: The caster's instrument.
