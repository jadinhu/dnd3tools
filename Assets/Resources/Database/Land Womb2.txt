You descend into a protective bubble in the earth 10 feet below where you are standing.
It appears as though the ground opened up and swallowed you.
A land womb only opens through tillable soil, not rock.
One additional creature per caster level can accompany you into the land womb.
Such creatures must be touching one another, with at least one touching you (a ring of hands, for instance).
Creatures inside the land womb can breath and speak normally, but the space is too tight to move about in or cast spells with somatic components.
The surface above the land womb cannot be sensed without magical means, and anything within the land womb cannot be detected by divination spells of 4th level or lower.
At the end of the duration, or upon the spell's dismissal, everything inside the land womb returns to the spot where it stood before the spell took effect.
