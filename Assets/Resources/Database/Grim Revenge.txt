The hand of the subject tears itself away from one of his arms, leaving a bloody stump.
This trauma deals 6d6 points of damage.
Then the hand, animated and floating in the air, begins to attack the subject.
The hand attacks as if it were a wight (see the Monster Manual) in terms of its statistics, special attacks, and special qualities, except that it is considered Tiny and gains a +4 bonus to AC and a +4 bonus on attack rolls.
The hand can be turned or rebuked as a wight.
If the hand is defeated, only a regenerate spell can restore the victim to normal.
