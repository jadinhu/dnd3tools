The subject of this powerful spell is unable to die from hit point damage. While under the protection of this spell, the normal limit of � ;9 hit points before a character dies is extended without limit. A condition or spell that destroys enough of the subject's body so as to not allow <b>raise dead</b> to work, such as a <b>disintegrate</b> effect, still kills the creature, as does death brought about by ability score damage, level drain, or a death effect.
	
The spell does not prevent the subject from entering the dying state by dropping to � ;1 hit points. It merely prevents death as a result of hit point loss.
	
If the subject has fewer than � ;9 hit points when the spell's duration expires, it dies instantly.
