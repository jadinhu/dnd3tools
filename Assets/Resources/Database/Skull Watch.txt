The skull affected by a skull watch spell floats gently 5 feet off the ground, facing a direction you choose.
It monitors an area 20 feet wide by 90 feet long, though walls and other solid barriers can curtail this area.
If any living creature enters the area guarded by the skull, it emits a piercing shriek that can be heard up to a quarter of a mile away and falls to the ground, its magic expended.
Every creature within 60 feet of the skull when it shrieks must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d6 rounds.
Whether or not you can hear this audible alarm, you instantly become aware when one of your skull watch spells has been triggered, provided you are on the same plane as it is.
The skull can be moved from its original position by anyone who can get to it without entering its monitored area.
The skull has an AC of 12, a hardness of 1, and 1 hit point per caster level.
You are not magically made aware of the skull's destruction if it has not been triggered.
Skull watch can be made permanent with the permanency spell.
A permanent skull watch resets 1d4 rounds after it is triggered.
Focus: The humanoid skull upon which skull watch is cast.
