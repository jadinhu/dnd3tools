The tree trunk bulges, then spits forth a humanoid form made of wood.
Its features shift, creaking and cracking, until they resemble your own.
You draw forth a humanoid figure from the wood of a tree that is at least one size category larger than yourself.
The figure is your size and clearly made of wood, but it resembles you sufficiently that anyone who knows you can recognize your features in its face.
The figure can emerge from the tree you touch, or from any tree of the same type within the spell's range.
Thereafter, if you and the forest child separate by more than the maximum range of the spell, or if you lose line of effect to it, it vanishes instantly and the spell ends.
A forest child mimics your actions, including speech, unless you direct it to act differently as a move action.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing in its location, and you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action anytime during your turn.
While you are using its senses, your own body is considered blinded and deafened.
If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the forest child instead of from you.
It cannot, however, cast any spells on itself.
Spells cast through the forest child function normally in all respects except for the point of origin.
A forest child has a number of hit points equal to your character level.
If you use it to attack physically, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, and it deals damage equal to your unarmed damage.
As a standard action, you can change places with your duplicate.
(Although the spell itself is a transmutation, this usage is a conjuration [teleportation] effect).
Making use of this option reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 5 rounds.
If you have fewer than 5 rounds of duration left, you cannot invoke this ability.
If you cast this spell along with both forest eyes and forest voice (see below), the duration of forest child doubles, and its range quadruples.
Material Component: A small hardwood replica of yourself, which costs 10 gp to create.
