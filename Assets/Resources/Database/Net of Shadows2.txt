<b>You cast the spell, and the surrounding shadows shift at your command, flying toward your targets and wrapping themselves around them.</b>
	
This spell gives the subjects concealment, but the shifting magic shadows also inhibit the subjects' ability to ascertain their surroundings. The subjects can see only 5 feet through the shadows that coat them, and foes within that range have concealment from the subjects. Darkvision does not penetrate a net of shadows.
