You radiate energy that gently pushes plants aside, allowing easy movement and hiding your trail after you pass.
Creatures in the effect (including the caster) find the undergrowth held aside as they pass.
This essentially provides a &quot;trail&quot; through any terrain (see Table 9-5: Terrain and Overland Movement, page 164 of the Player's Handbook).
Once you have passed, plants return to their normal shapes.
The DC to track anyone who traveled within the effect is increased by 5 (the equivalent of hiding the trail).
This spell cannot push or hold plant creatures aside.
