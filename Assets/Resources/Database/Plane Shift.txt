You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension.
If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time.
Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible.
From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination.
Note: Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends.
The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.
Focus: A small, forked metal rod.
The size and metal type dictates to which plane of existence or alternate dimension the spell sends the affected creatures.
Forked rods keyed to certain planes or dimensions may be difficult to come by, as decided by the DM.
