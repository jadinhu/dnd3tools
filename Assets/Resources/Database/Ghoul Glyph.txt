You inscribe a glyph that paralyzes any living creature of Large or smaller size that enters, passes, or opens the warded area.
You can scribe the glyph to be visible as faintly glowing lines, or invisible.
You can inscribe a ghoul glyph on a portable object, but if the object is moved more than 5 feet, the glyph fades.
Conditions for triggering a ghoul glyph are stringent.
It takes effect on any creature except yourself that moves to or within 2 feet of it.
It affects invisible creatures normally but is not triggered by those that travel past it ethereally.
Only a single ghoul glyph can be inscribed in a 5-foot square.
Ghoul glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled.
Mislead and nondetection can fool a ghoul glyph.
Read magic allows identification of a ghoul glyph with a successful DC 13 Spellcraft check, if the glyph is noticed before it is activated.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a ghoul glyph and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 27.
When a glyph is activated, the subject is paralyzed for 1d6+2 rounds.
Additionally, if the subject fails his Fortitude save, the paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes retching and nausea in a 10-foot radius.
Those in the radius must make a Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks until the spell ends.
Material Component: You trace the glyph with earth from a ghoul's lair.
