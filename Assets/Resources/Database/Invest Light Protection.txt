You invest the target with an infusion of divine energy.
His wounds knit shut, while the power you grant to him helps ward off future injuries.
You heal a living creature you touch of 1d4 points of damage +1 per two caster levels (maximum +3).
In addition, the creature touched gains damage reduction 1/evil for 1 minute.
Like cure light wounds, this spell deals damage to undead creatures instead of curing them.
In addition, on a failed save undead creatures take an extra 1 point of damage from any weapon or physical attack capable of overcoming good damage reduction for 1 minute.
