You direct a ray of energy that damages ectoplasm.
You must make a ranged touch attack roll to hit, and if the ray hits a ghost or object made of ectoplasm, it deals 1d6 points of damage to it.
This damage bypasses the hardness of ectoplasmic objects and the damage reduction of ectoplasmic creatures.
