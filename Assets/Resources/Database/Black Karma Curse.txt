With a word and a gesture, you compel the bewildered creature to attack itself.
If the target creature's saving throw fails, it immediately takes damage as if it had hit itself with its currently wielded weapon (or natural weapon).
If the creature has more than one eligible attack form, it uses the one that deals the most damage.
