The caster chooses to wither either the arms or the legs of a humanoid.
Withered legs force a subject to fall prone while at the same time reducing the subject's land speed to 5 feet.
Withered arms make it impossible for the subject to use objects or cast spells with somatic components.
A withered limb can be restored by a successful dispel magic cast by a spellcaster of a level higher than the level of the wither limb caster.
