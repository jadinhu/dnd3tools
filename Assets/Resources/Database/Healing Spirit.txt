A 1-foot-diamater ball of light appears and moves by your command, healing those it touches.
You conjure an incorporeal object of magical energy that appears in any square within range.
This healing spirit resembles a 1-foot-diameter ball of light.
It sheds bright illumination in a 10-foot radius and shadowy illumination for another 20 feet.
A healing spirit cannot be affected by attacks or spells.
A healing spirit flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability.
In the round you cast the spell and at the start of your turn once per round thereafter, you can direct the healing spirit to move and touch a creature by entering its space.
The spirit's touch carries positive energy, healing a living creature of 1d8 points of damage.
Since undead are powered by negative energy, a healing spirit damages them instead of healing them.
The spirit can affect an unwilling target (such as an undead) by succeeding on an incorporeal touch attack, using your base attack bonus and a Strength bonus of +0.
An undead creature hit by such an attack can use spell resistance against the effect and is allowed a Will save for half damage.
If a healing spirit travels farther from you than the spell's range, it winks out of existence and the spell ends.
