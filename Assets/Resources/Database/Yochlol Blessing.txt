A husky female chuckle accompanies the violet light that limns the target, illuminating the eight writhing tentacles that ooze from its body.
You infuse a target with the vile power of a yochlol, one of the demonic handmaidens of Lolth, causing its body to erupt with eight tendrils.
As a full-round action, the target can make eight primary tentacle attacks (using its normal reach), each dealing 1d4 points of damage.
These attacks can't be combined with any other weapon or natural weapon attacks.
In addition, the target gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus (minimum +1, maximum +5) and resistance 10 to acid and electricity.
The target of this spell is also treated as an outsider of the evil and shapechanger subtypes (in addition to its normal type and subtypes).
