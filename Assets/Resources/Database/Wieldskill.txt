This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance.
The subject gains a +10 competence bonus on a skill check of your choice.
If the target has no ranks in the skill, she functions as if she had a half rank in the skill, and therefore is considered trained in the skill (although this half rank adds nothing to her rolls with that skill).
Alternatively, the target gains proficiency with a single weapon (simple, martial, or exotic) or type of armor (light, medium, heavy, or shield) as if she had the appropriate feat.
