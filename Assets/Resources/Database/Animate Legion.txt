You use negative energy to temporarily animate one or more corpses.
You can create undead skeletons or zombies with this spell, but you can't create more Hit Dice of undead than twice your caster level.
The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons (page 226) and zombies (page 266).
The undead created are mindless and are not initially under your command.
Unless otherwise influenced (by way of a rebuke attempt or the control undead spell from the Player's Handbook, for instance), the undead created will attack the nearest living creatures.
See animate dead, page 199 of the Player's Handbook, for information on what is required to create a skeleton or zombie from a corpse.
Material Component: A black onyx gem worth at least 100 gp.
