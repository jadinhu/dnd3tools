You conjure a radiant, macelike scepter of solid light, approximately 3 feet long and 1 inch in diameter, with a dazzling, spherical ball measuring 5 inches in diameter at one end.
The sun scepter functions as a physical weapon that deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and has the axiomatic, disruption, and flaming burst special abilities.
You can strike with it as a melee touch attack.
The sun scepter lasts only as long as you hold it in your hand; it instantly fades away if you drop it or hand it off to an ally.
