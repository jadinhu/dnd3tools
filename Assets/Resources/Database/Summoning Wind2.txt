You send a message or sound on the wind to a number of specific creatures that you identify while casting the spell.
The specific identity of each recipient need not be known,
but you must be able to distinguish them by their position or some feature other than race or character class.
For example, you could send the message to the soldiers of your palace guard or to the governors of all the provinces in the empire.
The summoning wind travels to each recipient, provided that it can find a way from you to their locations.
(It can't pass through walls, for instance).
The summoning wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the recipients.
It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound and dissipates.
You can prepare the spell to bear a message of up to twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the summoning wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air.
You can likewise cause the summoning wind to move as slowly as one mile per hour or as quickly as one mile per 10 minutes.
When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains until the message is delivered.
As with magic mouth, summoning wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.
This spell is commonly used to rally troops, send warnings, or disseminate proclamations.
