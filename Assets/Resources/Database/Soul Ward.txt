Your comrade's thoughts and feelings meld with yours, each bolstering the other, through the touch of your hand.
This spell functions like body ward (page 117), except that you choose one of the three mental abilities � ;Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma � ;rather than a physical ability to be affected.
