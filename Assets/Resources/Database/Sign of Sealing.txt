You seal a door, chest, or similar closure with a prominent magical sigil that bars entry and prevents opening.
A door or object protected by this spell can be opened only by breaking (add 10 to the normal break DC) or by the use of knock or dispel magic.
If the door or object is forced open by any means (magical or physical), the sign of sealing deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) in a 30-foot radius (Reflex half).
A knock spell doesn't negate or automatically bypass a sign of sealing, but will suppress the sign for 10 minutes on a successful caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the sign's creator).
A sign of sealing is a magical trap that can be disarmed with a successful DC 28 Disable Device check.
You can pass your own sign safely, and it remains set behind you.
Material Component: A crushed emerald worth 100 gp.
