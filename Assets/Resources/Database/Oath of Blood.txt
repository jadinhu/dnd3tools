Oath of blood functions only when cast on a creature that has recently been subject to a geas or similar spell.
It extends the reach of the geas beyond death.
If the individual subject to the geas dies before completing the task, oath of blood animates him as an undead creature in order that he might continue his quest.
The nature of the undead creature is determined by the caster level of this spell, as per create undead (see page 215 of the Player's Handbook).
Once the task is complete or the original geas (or similar spell) expires, the magic animating the subject ends and he returns to death.
Material Component: Grave dirt mixed with powdered onyx worth at least 40 gp per HD of the target.
