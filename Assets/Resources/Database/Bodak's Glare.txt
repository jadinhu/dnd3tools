This spell allows you to channel the deadly gaze of the bodak.
Upon completion of the spell, you may target a creature within range that can see you.
That creature dies instantly unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.
The target need not meet your gaze.
If you slay a humanoid creature with this attack, it transforms into a bodak 24 hours later unless it has been resurrected in the meantime.
The bodak is not under your command, but can be controlled as normal with a rebuke undead check.
