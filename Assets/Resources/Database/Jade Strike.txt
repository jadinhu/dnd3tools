You call up holy jade power to smite your enemies.
Only Tainted creatures, undead, and creatures with the Shadowlands subtype are harmed by the spell; other creatures are unaffected.
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to undead and creatures with the Shadowlands subtype, and blinds them for 1 round.
A successful Reflex save reduces damage to half and negates the blinding effect.
The spell deals only half damage against creatures with a Taint score (and without the Shadowlands subtype), and they are not blinded.
They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Reflex save.
In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a <del>4 penalty on most Strength</del> and Dexterity-based skills.
