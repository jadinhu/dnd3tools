You can make your voice (or any sound that you can normally make vocally) seem to issue from someplace else, such as from another creature, a statue, from behind a door, down a passage, etc.
You can speak in any language you know.
With respect to such voices and sounds, anyone who hears the sound and rolls a successful save recognizes it as illusory (but still hears it).
Focus: A parchment rolled up into a small cone.
