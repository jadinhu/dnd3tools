You gain the ability to step into fires and move from fire to fire.
The fires you enter and move between must be at least as big around as you are.
Fire elementals and other fire creatures are not &quot;fires&quot; for purposes of fire stride, nor are sources of great heat such as pools of lava.
Once in a fire, you can transport yourself to any other sufficiently large fire within long range (400 ft. + 40 ft./level), and you instantly know the locations of all suitable fires within range.
Each transport counts as a full move action.
With each casting of the spell, you can transport yourself one time per caster level.
If a fire's location doesn't offer enough space for you (for example, a fire contained inside a furnace too small to hold you or a fire already occupied by a big cauldron), it is not a viable destination and you don't sense its location.
If a fire rests on a surface that can't support you, it is still a viable destination and you suffer the appropriate consequences if you transport yourself to it.
For example, if you transport yourself into a fire burning in a pit full of oil, you fall into the oil when you arrive there.
The spell provides no protection against fire, so it is advisable to obtain such protection before using the spell.
