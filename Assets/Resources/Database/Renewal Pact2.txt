This spell remains dormant until the subject is subjected to one or more of the following adverse conditions: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, or poisoned. One round after the subject is affected by a condition that triggers the renewal pact, the subject receives a <b>panacea</b> spell (page 152) at a caster level equal to that of the caster of the <b>renewal pact</b>.
	
A creature can be subject to only one <b>renewal pact</b> at a time. Casting <b>renewal pact</b> on a subject who already has an untriggered <b>renewal pact</b> voids the earlier pact.
