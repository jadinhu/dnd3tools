This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of a symbol of persuasion instead become charmed by the caster (as the charm monster spell) for 1 hour per caster level.
Unlike symbol of death, symbol of persuasion has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of persuasion simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
Note:Magic traps such as symbol of persuasion are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of persuasion and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for symbol of persuasion.
Material Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.
