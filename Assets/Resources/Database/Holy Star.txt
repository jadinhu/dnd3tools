 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action

 <b>Effect:</b> Protective star of energy

You create a glowing mote of energy that stays near your shoulder, providing light equal to a candle.
It has three functions, and you can designate which function to activate as a free action on your turn.
Spell Turning: The holy star can turn four to seven (1d4+3) spell levels as the spell turning spell.
Any spell levels turned are gone for the remainder of the spell (the holy star does not recover these spent levels every time you choose this function).
If all spell levels are expended, this function no longer works but the other functions do.
Cover: The holy star gives you a +10 cover bonus to AC without affecting your actions.
Fire Bolt: The holy star lashes out with a beam of energy as a ranged touch attack against a creature up to 90 feet away, dealing fire damage equal to 1d4 points +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10).
