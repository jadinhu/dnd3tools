Fortissimo doubles the volume of one source of sound specified by the caster.
Bards often use this spell to help their music carry to larger audiences ï¿½ ;or just be heard over the din of a noisy tavern.
When casting fortissimo on a creature, the caster may specify items that the creature is wearing or carrying for inclusion in the effect.
For example, casting fortissimo on a singer and including her lute would make both her song and her accompaniment twice as loud.
If the affected creature or item can generate a sonic or language-based attack, such as a command spell, a harpy's song, the fascinate effect of bardic music, or a horn of blasting,
the saving throw DC against that attack increases by +2.
If a sonic attack deals damage (like a shout), the spell increases that damage by +1d6 points.
Fortissimo counters and dispels silence and is countered and dispelled by it.
If cast at a target affected by silence, it negates the effect for that creature or item only.
