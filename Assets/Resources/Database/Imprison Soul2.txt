By casting imprison soul, you place the subject's soul in a receptacle, such as a gem, ring, or some other miniscule object, leaving her body lifeless.
While trapped, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage per day until dead or freed.
The rituals to prepare the receptacle require three days.
Destroying or opening the receptacle ends the spell, releasing the soul.
To cast the spell, you must know the name of the target.
The receptacle must be within spell range and you must know where it is.
Material Component: A portion of the target's body (a fingernail, a strand of hair, or some other small part).
Focus: A Tiny or smaller object to be the receptacle for the subject's soul.
