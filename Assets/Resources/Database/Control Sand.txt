Depending on the version you choose, control sand raises or lowers fine particles of material, such as dust or sand.
For either version, the caster can reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.
Lower Sand: This effect causes sand to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level, to a minimum depth of 1 inch.
The dust and sand is lowered within a square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level.
In extremely large and deep sand piles, such as a sand dune, the spell creates a pit that sweeps creatures downward (without dealing damage), putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.
When cast on earth elementals, dust paraelementals, and other earth- or dust-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates).
The spell has no effect on other creatures.
Raise Sand: This effect causes dust and sand to rise in height, just as the lower sand version causes it to lower.
Creatures and objects on top of the dust or sand are raised along with the top level of sand.
