By casting this spell, you request the aid of a marut inevitable.
If you know an individual marut's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway).
You may ask the marut to perform one duty for you.
The task must be in harmony with its lawful objective, and must take no more than nine days to complete.
Maruts confront those, like liches, who would try to deny the grave.
The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task.
After nine days, or if asked to do something nonlawful, frivolous, or not focused on its lawful objective, the marut will leave.
XP Cost: 500 XP.
