You sense the distance and direction to the nearest community of a minimum size designated by you at the time of casting.
For instance, you could choose to find the nearest community at least as large as a village, or you could choose to locate only the nearest metropolis.
This spell measures the distance to the &quot;nearest&quot;
community as the minimum distance one would have to travel to reach the city without moving through solid objects.
Thus, a caster on the surface isn't likely to locate a subterranean city half a mile beneath his feet, even if the next closest community is 5 miles away overland.
