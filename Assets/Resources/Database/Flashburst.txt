Flashburst creates a blinding, dazzling flash of light.
Sighted creatures within the area are automatically dazzled for 1 round (-1 penalty on attack rolls), and possibly blinded for 2d8 rounds (Will negates).
Creatures outside the area, but within 120 feet of the burst, can be blinded if they have line of sight to the burst (Will negates).
The spell does not dazzle creatures outside the burst area.
In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded character suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a <del>4 penalty on most Strength</del> and Dexterity-based skill checks.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of sulfur or phosphorus.
