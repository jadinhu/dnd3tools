Sometimes called &quot;trollkiller&quot;, this spell causes a single creature to burst into flames, taking 2d6 points of fire damage immediately upon a failed saving throw.
Each round thereafter, throughout the spell's duration, the target takes another 2d6 points of fire damage.
In any round when the target takes a move action to douse the flames, it can attempt a new Reflex save.
Success on any save after the first round causes the flames to die out and ends the spell.
In addition to the above effects, the target shoots off gouts of flame every round that it remains on fire.
Any creature within 10 feet of the target takes 1d4 points of fire damage per round.
A successful Reflex save negates this damage.
Material Component: A pinch of saltpeter, a small piece of phosphorus, and a scrap of lace cloth or a spiderweb.
