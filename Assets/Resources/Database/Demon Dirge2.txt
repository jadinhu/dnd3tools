You cry out the ancient words and make the prescribed motions, and your foe lets out a howl of pain as his blood boils in his veins.
	
Demon dirge deals 2d6 points of damage each round for the duration of the spell to any creature that has both the chaotic and evil subtypes (such as a howler or a demon). No saving throw is allowed against this damage.
	
If the target creature also possesses the tanar'ri subtype (MM 316), the spell has a much more powerful effect. In addition to the damage, a tanar?ri is stunned for the duration of the spell unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.</p <b>Also appears in</b>   Planar Handbook
