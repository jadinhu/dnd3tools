The target creature loses its natural buoyancy, sinking like a stone in water or liquids of similar density (but not mud or lava).
Each round, the affected creature must make a DC 25 Swim check simply to keep its head above water, or a DC 30 Swim check to move 5 feet in any direction.
Failing a check by 5 or more causes the target to go underwater, and it must hold its breath or begin to drown (see Drowning on page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Failing a check by 10 or more causes the target to sink 5 feet.
A DC 25 Swim check is needed to surface by 5 feet.
A creature under the effect of sink is adequately ballasted to walk on the bottom, if it so chooses.
A creature with a swim speed takes a -10 ft. penalty to its swim speed (minimum 5 ft.)
and sinks 5 feet every round at the end of its turn unless it succeeds on a DC 25 Swim check.
Sink counters and dispels wave blessing.
