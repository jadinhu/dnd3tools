You imbue the energy of your breath weapon with coherence, mobility, and a semblance of life.
The animated breath then attacks whomever or whatever you designate.
The spell works only on breath weapons that deal energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) damage.
The animated breath has the following characteristics.
Type: Construct.
Subtype: The same as yours, or the energy type of your breath weapon if you do not have a subtype.
Size: One size smaller than you.
Hit Dice: Equal to the number of dice of damage your breath weapon deals.
The Hit Dice are 10-sided.
Constructs also receive bonus hit points based on size:
Diminutive, Tiny: � ;
Small: 10
Medium: 20
Large: 30
Huge: 40
Gargantuan: 60
Colossal: 80
Speed: Varies by breath type:
Acid: 20 ft., swim 90 ft.
Cold: 30 ft.
Electricity: Fly 100 ft. (perfect)
Fire: 50 ft.
Sonic: Fly 100 ft. (perfect)
AC: The animated breath's natural armor bonus varies by size:
Diminutive or Tiny: +2
Small or Medium: +3
Large: +4
Huge: +8
Gargantuan: +10
If your breath weapon uses force energy, this bonus is an armor bonus composed of force (like that granted by mage armor) rather than a natural armor bonus.
Attacks: The animated breath makes slam attacks according to its Hit Dice.
Damage: Each successful hit deals bludgeoning damage (varies by size of the animated breath; see below) plus energy damage equal to one die of the same size as your breath weapon damage.
Diminutive: 1d2
Tiny: 1d3
Small: 1d4
Medium: 1d6
Large: 1d8
Huge: 2d6
Gargantuan: 2d8
For example, a Colossal red dragon's animated breath is Gargantuan in size, so it deals 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage on a successful hit � ;plus 1d10 points of fire damage, because d10 is the size of die used to determine a red dragon's breath weapon damage.
Special Qualities: Creatures that hit the animated breath with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take energy damage as though hit by the breath's attack.
Construct Traits: The animated breath is immune to mindaffecting effects, and to poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects.
The breath is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage.
Saves: The animated breath has no good saves.
All of its save bonuses are 1/3 of its Hit Dice plus the appropriate ability modifier.
Abilities: The animated breath has no Constitution or Intelligence score.
Its Wisdomand Charisma scores are both 1.
Its Strength and Dexterity vary by size:
Diminutive: Str 6, Dex 16
Tiny: Str 8, Dex 14
Small: Str 10, Dex 12
Medium: Str 12, Dex 10
Large: Str 16, Dex 10
