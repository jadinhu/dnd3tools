The caster play a gentle melody that lulls the senses of those who hear it.
Any creature within the area that fails a Will save becomes
drowsy and inattentive, suffering a -2 circumstance penalty on Spot and Listen checks and a -2 circumstance penalty on Will saves against sleep while the lullaby is in effect.
Many bards use this spell in conjunction with either ambient song or a silent or disguised spell to improve the odds against anyone noticing such a ruse.
