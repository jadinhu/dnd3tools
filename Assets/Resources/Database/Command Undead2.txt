This spell allows you some degree of control over an undead creature.
	
Nonintelligent undead (such as skeletons and zombies) get no saving throw; intelligent undead do.
	
When you control a mindless being, you can only communicate basic commands, such as &quot;come here&quot;, &quot;go there&quot;, &quot;fight&quot;, &quot;stand still&quot;, and so on.
	
An intelligent subject perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. It will hot attack you while the spell lasts.
	
You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries not allowed).
	
A commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing (see the charm person spell description on page 183 of the Player's Handbook).
	
Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead breaks the spell. Your commands are not telepathic.
	
The undead creature must be able to hear you.
	
Material Components: A shred of raw meat and a splinter of bone.
