<b>You shift across the battlefield, timing your movements precisely to avoid any attacks from your foes.</b>
	
Your sense of the battlefield and intuitive understanding of the ebb and flow of combat allow you to move without dropping your defenses. While others must slowly work through a melee, you seize gaps in a foe?s defenses and move with great speed and confidence.
	
While you are in this stance, you can take a second 5-foot step immediately after you take one for the round. This second movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can make a single 5-foot step into difficult terrain, but if you do, you cannot make the second 5-foot step.</p
