You determine whether a creature, object, or area is infected with disease or carries disease.
You can determine the exact type of disease with a successful Wisdom check (DC 20).
A character with the Heal skill may try a Heal check (DC 20) if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Heal check prior to the Wisdom check.
Note: The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
