As vine mine, but the vines you create are poisonous (contact, 1d6 Dex/2d6 Dex).
A successful Fortitude save is required only upon the first entry into the area of effect (and again 1 minute later); creatures don't have to save each time they enter (or each round they remain within).
You are immune to the poison of the vines you create, and you can select a number of other targets equal to your level to share this immunity.
