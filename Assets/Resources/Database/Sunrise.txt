You create a burst of dazzling light that is equivalent to natural sunlight.
Any creature in the area to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural is blinded and takes 4d6 points of damage; every other creature in the area is blinded and takes 2d6 points of damage.
A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and halves the damage in either case.
An undead creature caught within the burst takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and halves the damage.
The ultraviolet light generated by the spell also deals damage to fungi, molds, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.
Sunrise dispels any darkness spells of 3rd level or lower within its area.
