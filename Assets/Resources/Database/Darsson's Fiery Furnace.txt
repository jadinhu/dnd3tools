You raise the temperature in the affected area to the level of extreme heat (as defined under Heat Dangers, page 303 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
For every minute spent breathing the air in the area, a creature vulnerable to heat takes 1d6 points of lethal damage (no save).
In addition, the creature must make a Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage.
Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a -4 penalty on their saves.
In addition, those wearing metal armor, as well as those coming in contact with metal that has been in the area for
at least 1 hour, are affected as if by a heat metal spell.
This spell was originally developed as a means of cooking food (cast inside cauldrons, brick ovens, and smoke houses), but wizards quickly determined that it could be used as a deterrent (on long hallways or in treasure vaults, for example) or for creating a comfortable environment for heat-loving pets.
Darsson's fiery furnace can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
