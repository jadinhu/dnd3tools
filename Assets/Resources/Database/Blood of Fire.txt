When you cast this spell, you cut a mystic pattern into one palm with a knife and enchant your own blood.
The spell creates one missile of blood per three caster levels (maximum of five missiles).
You can then send these missiles of blood streaking from the upturned palm, which explode on impact.
You can choose a separate target for each missile, but you must make a ranged touch attack for each missile.
A direct hit deals 2d8 points of damage with no saving throw allowed.
Creatures within 5 feet of a creature struck by a missile must make successful Reflex saves or take the same damage.
(Missiles that miss their target do not cause damage to any creature).
Material Component: Your blood.
Cutting the pattern in your palm deals 2 points of damage to you.
