This spell gives the recipient a swim speed equal to its land speed (though not the ability to breathe water or hold its breath beyond normal limits).
So long as the creature isn't carrying more than a light load, it can swim at its normal speed without making Swim checks.
It also gains a +8 competence bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard.
The creature can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered.
It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
If the creature is carrying more than a light load, it must make Swim checks to move (taking the normal penalty for weight carried), but all other benefits and bonuses of the spell still apply.
Arcane Material Component: A goldfish scale.
