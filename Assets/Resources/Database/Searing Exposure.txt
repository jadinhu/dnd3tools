You expose the target to the effect of hours of exposure to severe heat and the desert sun in only a moment.
The subject must make a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 15d4).
Nonlethal damage that exceeds the subject's hit points is considered lethal damage.
In addition, the subject is dazzled (as if by sun glare), dehydrated, and sunburned (see Chapter 1).
Protection from heat and exposure (such as keepcool salve or a hydration suit; see Chapter 4) helps mitigate these effects, providing the target with a +4 bonus on the Fortitude save.
A creature wearing heavy clothing or armor takes a -4 penalty on the Fortitude saving throw, but is not sunburned.
Those that succeed on their Fortitude saves take half damage, are dehydrated, and are dazzled for 1d4+1 rounds.
Arcane Material Component: A shard of thick glass.
