With a touch, your foe becomes visibly enfeebled, as if a sudden weight of years had dropped onto his shoulders.
Your touch deals 3 points of drain to the subject's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores; a successful Fortitude save negates this effect and prevents any further harm.
If the subject fails its initial saving throw, it takes another 3 points of drain to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores each day thereafter as long as the spell lasts.
A successful Fortitude save negates this drain, but doesn't end the spell's duration.
The ability drain from this spell can be eliminated as normal, but doing this doesn't end the spell's duration.
If you cast this spell on a creature while another casting of touch of years is already in effect on it, the second spell doesn't deal ability drain.
Instead, a failed initial Fortitude save renders the creature permanently deafened and blinded.
These conditions can be removed by normal means (such as remove blindness/deafness), but doing this has no effect on the ability drain.
This spell can't be dispelled, but any effect that would remove a curse allows the spellcaster a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level) to end the spell's duration.
This doesn't restore any ability score points already lost.
