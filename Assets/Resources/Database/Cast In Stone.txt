Anyone meeting your gaze is permanently turned into a mindless, inert statue (as flesh to stone).
You may free the victim of your own cast in stone at any time by speaking a command word you establish during the casting.
Note: Each round, a gaze attack automatically works against one creature within range that is looking at (attacking or interacting with) the gazing creature.
Creatures can avert their eyes, which grants them a 50% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants the gazer one-half concealment (20% miss chance) relative to them.
Creatures can close their eyes or turn away entirely; doing so prevents the gaze from affecting them but grants the gazer total concealment (50% miss chance) relative to them.
