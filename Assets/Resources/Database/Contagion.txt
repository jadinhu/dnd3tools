The subject contracts a disease selected from the table below, which strikes immediately (no incubation period). The DC noted is for the subsequent saves (use contagion's normal save DC for the initial saving throw). See the Dungeon Master's Guide for descriptions of each disease, as well as for the general effects of disease.
