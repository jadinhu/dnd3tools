By casting this spell, you request the aid of a zelekhut inevitable.
If you know an individual zelekhut's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway).
You may ask the zelekhut to perform one duty for you.
The task must be in harmony with its lawful objective, and must take no more than five days to complete.
Zelekhuts hunt down those who would deny justice or seek to flee to escape punishment.
The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task.
After five days, or if asked to do something nonlawful, frivolous, or not focused on its lawful objective, the zelekhut will leave.
XP Cost: 100 XP.
