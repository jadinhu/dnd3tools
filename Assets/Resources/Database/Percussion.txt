Percussion fills the immediate area with the sounds of drums, chimes, and other percussive instruments.
The music can range from the gentle tapping of a single tom-tom to the thunder of a squad of drummers.
Upon casting the spell, you set the tempo of the drums and the rhythm they repeat.
Thereafter, you can change the tempo, rhythm, or volume simply by concentrating for 1 round.
Bards often use this spell to provide background accompaniment for their own music and songs.
The sounds produced are no louder than real drums would be, but the effect is realistic enough to fool anyone who can't see that no drummers are present.
Material Component: Two smooth wooden sticks, which you must touch together to cast the spell.
