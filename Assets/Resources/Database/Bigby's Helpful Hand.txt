A magical construct in the shape of a hand appears next to you.
Its fingers open toward you, waiting for you to hand it an item.
This spell creates a hand of magical force that holds items for you, helps you complete long, involved tasks, and otherwise aids you.
The spell grants you a +2 competence bonus on Craft, Disable Device, and Open Lock checks for the duration of the spell.
It can hold a single object weighing up to 20 pounds.
You can grasp the object that the hand carries or place an object in its grasp as a swift action.
The hand remains in your square at all times.
It matches your speed, and you can bring the hand and the object along with you if you use dimension door, teleport, and similar spells.
You cannot order the hand to move away from you.
If you are separated from the hand, the spell immediately ends.
The hand is about 1 foot long.
It has hit points equal to half your full normal hit points, and its AC is 20 (+4 size, +6 natural).
It makes saving throws using your total save bonuses and takes damage from spells and attacks as normal.
Focus: A soft glove.
