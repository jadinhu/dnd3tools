This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 5 feet.
The barrier moves with the subject and has two major effects.
First, the subject gets a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against attacks made by spirits.
Second, the barrier prevents spirits from entering the area.
This protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against a blocked spirit.
Spell resistance can allow a spirit to overcome this protection and enter the circle.
Focus: A gingko wand with paper prayer strips attached.
