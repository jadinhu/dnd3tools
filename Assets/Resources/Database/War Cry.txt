You attack with a cry that bolsters your own courage as well as intimidating your enemies.
As a result of this spell, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, or a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made as part of a charge.
If you deal damage with a melee attack, your foe must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 1 round (spell resistance applies to this effect).
An opponent who makes a successful saving throw against this effect cannot be affected again by the same casting of war cry.
