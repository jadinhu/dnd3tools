Maelstrom causes a deadly vortex to form in water.
A body of water at least 120 feet wide and 60 feet deep must be present, or the spell is wasted.
Waterborne creatures or objects within 50 feet of the vortex (below and on all sides) must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked in.
Trained swimmers can attempt Swim checks instead if their skill modifier is higher than their Reflex save bonus.
Waterborne vessels avoid being sucked in if their operators make Profession (sailor) checks against the same DC as the spell's saving throw.
These creatures take 3d8 points of damage upon being sucked in.
Once inside, creatures and objects take 3d8 points of battering damage each round.
They remain trapped for 2d4 rounds.
Subjects of Large or smaller size are ejected from the bottom of the vortex.
Larger subjects are ejected from the top.
