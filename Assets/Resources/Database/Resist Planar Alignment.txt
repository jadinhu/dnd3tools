This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from a plane's alignment traits.
When the subject visits a plane with an alignment trait, this spell grants it immunity to penalties on its Charisma check that mildly aligned planes impose on visitors of opposed alignments.
The Charisma, Wisdom and Intelligence check penalties associated with strongly aligned planes are halved while this spell's duration lasts.
