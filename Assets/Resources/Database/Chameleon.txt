This spell alters the coloration of the recipient's body and clothing so as to blend in with the surrounding background, granting the creature a +10 circumstance bonus on any Hide checks.
In areas where the background changes gradually (such as stepping from forest to green field), the coloration shifts quickly enough to grant the bonus while moving at up to one-half normal speed.
When the background changes abruptly (from forest to stone wall, for example), the creature loses the
circumstance bonus for 1 round while the coloration change takes effect.
Material Component: The shed skin of a small lizard.
