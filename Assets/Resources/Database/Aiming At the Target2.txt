When you cast this spell, you increase your ability to concentrate on a spell you have already cast.
This spell is one of only two spells that you can cast while maintaining concentration on another spell (the other being finding the center).
This spell gives you a +10 circumstance bonus on Concentration checks you make to maintain concentration on another spell, and lasts as long as your concentration on the other spell.
Casting aiming at the target is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.
