The target creature draws closer to an ideal state of nature, with specific effects that depend on the creature's type and abilities.
	
Animals, elementals, fey, outsiders with an elemental subtype (air, earth, fire, or water), oozes, plants, and vermin are unaffected by the spell.
	
Humanoids who are arcane spellcasters, as well as all monstrous humanoids, gain 1d4 negative levels when subjected to this spell.
	
Giants subjected to this spell become smaller, as though affected by a <b>reduce person</b> spell (see page 269 of the Player's Handbook). A successful Fortitude save negates this effect.
	
Dragons and magical beasts subjected to this spell take 1d6 points of Intelligence damage and lose the use of 1d4 supernatural or spell-like abilities, chosen at random. A successful Fortitude save reduces the Intelligence damage to half and negates the loss of abilities.
	
Outsiders with no elemental subtype take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8) and lose the use of 2d4 supernatural or spell-like abilities, chosen at random. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to half and negates the loss of abilities.
	
Aberrations take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and lose the use of all supernatural and spell-like abilities. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to half and negates the loss of abilities.
	
Lost supernatural and spell-like abilities return after 24 hours.
