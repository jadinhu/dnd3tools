You invoke the powers of deep darkness and your eyes vanish, looking like holes in the universe itself.
	
Upon completion of the spell, you target a creature within range that can see you. That creature dies instantly unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. The target need not meet your gaze.
	
If you slay a humanoid creature with this attack, 24 hours later it transforms into a bodak (MM 28) unless it has been resurrected in the meantime. The bodak is not under your command, but can be controlled as normal with a rebuke undead check.
	
Focus: A black onyx gem worth at least 500 gp.
