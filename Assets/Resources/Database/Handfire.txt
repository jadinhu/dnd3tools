You surround your hand with winking motes of light resembling a cluster of constantly renewed sparks.
The lights are any color you choose, but cannot be changed once the spell is cast.
The handfire provides illumination equal to a candle but provides no heat, nor can it ignite objects.
The handfire can be used as a melee touch attack up to one time per level.
If a living creature is struck, it deals 1d4 points of damage +1 point/level (maximum +5).
Against undead, the handfire deals 1d6 points of damage +1 point/level (maximum +5).
It has no effect on targets that are neither living nor undead (such as constructs).
