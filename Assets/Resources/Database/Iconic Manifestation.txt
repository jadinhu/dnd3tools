Your mind opens to an awareness of a new, spiritual world beyond the natural realm.
Its energies flow into you even as the spirits of the beasts and the trees always have.
The descriptor of this spell matches the non-neutral component of your own alignment.
For instance, if you are lawful neutral, you cast iconic manifestation as a lawful spell.
If you are neutral, you cannot cast it at all.
Once you cast the spell, you have up to 10 minutes per caster level to invoke its power before it is spent.
At any point during this period, you can choose to spend one daily use of your wild shape ability to take on aspects of your non-neutral alignment.
You temporarily acquire the celestial template (MM 31) if you are good, the fiendish template (MM 107) if you are evil, the anarchic template (Manual of the Planes 198) if you are chaotic, or the axiomatic template (Manual of the Planes 197) if you are lawful.
(If your campaign does not use Manual of the Planes, you can approximate the axiomatic template by using the celestial template, and substituting lawful for good and chaotic for evil.
You can approximate the anarchic template by using the fiendish template and making the same substitution).
Once invoked, this transformation lasts 1 minute per caster level.
You can still use your wild shape ability to take on other forms without negating this spell.
Note: Adding a template &quot;on the fly&quot; can dramatically slow game-play.
If you anticipate using this spell, write down the relevant adjustments � ;both to your normal formand to any animal, plant, or elemental forms you regularly assume � ;before play begins.
