Utterdark spreads from the caster, creating an area of cold, cloying magical darkness.
This darkness is similar to that created by the deeper darkness spell, but no magical light counters or dispels it.
Furthermore, evil-aligned creatures can see in this darkness as if it were simply a dimly lighted area.
Arcane Material Component: A black stick, 6 inches long, with humanoid blood smeared upon it.
