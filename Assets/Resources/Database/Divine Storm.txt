You create a spinning disk of weapons, of the type favored by your deity.
These weapons whirl around a central point, creating an
immobile circular barrier.
Any creature passing through the divine storm takes 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 2 points per caster level (maximum +20).
You choose the plane of rotation of the weapons: horizontal, vertical, or slanted.
Creatures within the divine storm when it is invoked can dodge out of the way and take no damage if they make a successful Reflex save.
Once the divine storm is in place, any creature entering or passing through the disk automatically takes damage.
A divine storm serves as one-half cover (+4 AC) for anyone beyond it.
Divine Focus: A tiny replica of the deity's weapon on a silver chain.
