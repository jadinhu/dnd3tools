You intone words of binding and point at your foe.
Yellow strings of magical energy loop about its wings, dragging it to ground.
You hinder the subject's ability to fly (whether through natural or magical means) for the duration of the spell.
If the target fails its saving throw, its fly speed (if any) becomes 0 feet.
An airborne creature subjected to this spell falls to the ground as if under the effect of a feather fall spell.
Even if a new effect would grant the creature the ability to fly, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the earthbind spell.
Earthbind has no effect on other forms of movement, or even on effects that might grant airborne movement without granting a fly speed (such as jumping or levitate or
air walk spells).
