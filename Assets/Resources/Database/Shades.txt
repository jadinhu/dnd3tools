Illusion (Shadow)
 <b>Level:</b>  Sorcerer 9,  Wizard 9,  Sha'ir 9,    
<b>Components:</b>

 	
This spell functions like shadow conjuration, except that it mimics sorcerer and wizard conjuration spells of 8th level or lower.
The illusory conjurations created deal four-fifths (80%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 80% likely to work against nonbelievers.
