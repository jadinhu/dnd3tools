<b>Components:</b>V, S, DF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action

You create a long whip of ghostly red energy that emanates from your hand and never harms you.
You wield this weapon as if it were an actual whip and you were proficient in it.
Attacks with the mystic lash are ranged touch attacks.
The lash deals 1d8 points of electrical damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +5).
Since the lash is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage.
A creature hit with the lash must make a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.
If the lash hits its target, you may release it from your hand so that it continues to attack that target automatically, leaving your hand free.
The lash attacks on your turn using your base attack value, although it can only attack once per round on its own.
If the lash's target falls unconscious, dies, or is destroyed, the lash returns to you on its next action.
If you do not grasp the lash on the round it returns, it dissipates, but otherwise you can use the lash on another creature and begin the cycle again.
