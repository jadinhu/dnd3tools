You summon an avalanche of snow out of a rift in midair, burying your foes and sending them to a frosty death.
The effect of an obedient avalanche on a creature depends on where it is in relation to the spell's point of origin, as follows.
Within 20 feet of the Point of Origin: Each creature in this area takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8), plus an additional 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels.
A creature that fails its save is also buried (as described on page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
All squares within 20 feet of the point of origin are covered in heavy snow (see page 94 of the Dungeon Master's Guide),
which persists as long as ordinary snow would.
Between 20 feet and 40 feet of the Point of Origin: A creature in this area takes half as much damage from the impact of the avalanche as one nearer the point of origin takes (Reflex save negates).
On a failed save, the snow has the additional effect of a bull rush, with a +13 bonus (+5 for an effective Strength of 20 and +8 for an effective size of Huge) on the requisite check.
With a successful bull rush, it pushes creatures away from the point of origin of the spell.
All squares in the ring 20 feet to 40 feet from the center point are covered in snow, which persists as long as ordinary snow would.
Terrain and Structures: The avalanche uproots small trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of light rubble (as described on page 91 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) even after the snow has melted.
A structure hit by an obedient avalanche takes 1d6x;10 points of damage.
An obedient avalanche extinguishes all flames it touches.
