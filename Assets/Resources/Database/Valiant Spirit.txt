You bestow the soul of a great ancient hero on the creature touched, giving him great skill in battle.
As an immediate action, he can activate the valiant spirit.
While active, the spirit's courage provides the recipient of the spell with a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, Fortitude saves, Strength checks, and Strength-based skill checks.
The valiant spirit remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends.
No creature can be the target of more than one valiant spirit spell simultaneously.
If a second is cast before the first has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect.
Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus provided by the spirit improves by 1.
