A bogun is a small nature servant created by a druid.
Like a homunculus, it is an extension of its creator, sharing the same alignment and link to nature.
A bogun does not fight particularly well, but it can perform any simple action, such as attacking, carrying a message, or opening a door or window.
For the most part, a bogun simply carries out its creator's instructions.
Because it is self-aware and somewhat willful, however, its behavior is not entirely predictable.
On rare occasions (5% of the time), the bogun may refuse to perform a particular task.
In that case, the creator must make a Diplomacy check (DC 11) to convince the creature to cooperate.
Success means the bogun performs the task as requested; failure indicates that it either does exactly the opposite or refuses to do anything at all for 24 hours (DM's option as to which).
A bogun cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator.
It knows what its creator knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, up to a range of 500 yards.
A bogun never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly.
In that case, it does everything in its power to regain contact with its creator.
An attack that destroys a bogun also deals its creator 2d10 points of damage.
If the creator is slain, the bogun also dies, and its body collapses into a heap of rotting vegetation.
A bogun looks like a vaguely humanoid mound of compost.
The creator determines its precise features, but the typical bogun stands about 18 inches tall and has a wingspan of about 2 feet.
Its skin is covered with nettles and branches.
Combat: A bogun attacks by brushing against opponents with harsh nettles that deliver an irritating poison.
Poison (Ex):Nettles, Fort save (DC 11); initial and secondary damage 1d6 temporary Dex.
The creator of a bogun is immune to its poison.
Construct Traits: A bogun has immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless.
It is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.
Cannot heal damage, but can be repaired.
Darkvision 60 ft. and low-light vision.
Construction: Unlike a homunculus, a bogun is created from natural materials available in any forest.
Thus, there is no gold piece cost for its creation.
All materials used become permanent parts of the bogun.
The creator must be at least 7th level and possess the Craft Wondrous Item feat to make a bogun.
Before casting any spells, a physical form must be woven out of living (or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the magical energy.
A bit of the creator's own body, such as a few strands of hair or a drop of blood, must also be incorporated into this crude mannequin.
The creator may assemble the body personally or hire someone else to do it.
Creating the mannequin requires a Craft (basketweaving or weaving) check (DC 12).
Once the body is finished, the creator must animate it through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to complete.
The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from another sentient creature undoes the magic.
If the creator is personally weaving the creature's body, that process and the ritual can be performed together.
When not actively working on the ritual, the creator must rest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking.
Missing even one day causes the process to fail.
At that point, the ritual must be started anew, though the previously crafted body and the grove can be reused.
On the final day of the ritual, the creator must personally cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun.
These spells can come from outside sources, such as scrolls, rather than being prepared, if the creator prefers.
