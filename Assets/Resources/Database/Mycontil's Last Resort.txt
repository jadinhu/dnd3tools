You unleash deadly explosive power, similar to the effects of a retributive strike created by breaking a staff of power (see page 245 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information).
The spell converts any remaining spell slots in your mind into a blast of magical energy.
All creatures within 10 feet of you take 8 points of damage per spell slot remaining, creatures between 11 and 20 feet take 6 points per spell slot, and creatures between 21 and 30 feet take 4 points per remaining spell slot.
You take maximum damage and are allowed no saving throw.
It is widely thought that Mycontil and his assistants used this spell in a circle magic ceremony to defeat the Arkaiun barbarian chieftain, Reinhar I of Dambrath, during Dambrath's invasion of Halruaa.
Mycontil and his assistants vanished after the blast and were presumed destroyed.
There has been no other recorded use of the spell.
Material Component: The finger bone of an archmage that has been packed in diamond dust worth 5,000 gp for 1 week.
