You conjure a featureless black sphere of nothingness that disintegrates virtually anything it touches.
The sphere flies up to 30 feet per round, and you must make a ranged touch attack against the single creature or object you wish to target.
The sphere stops moving during the round when it attacks, and you must actively direct it to a new target as a move action.
When struck by the sphere, a target takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6).
Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust (though its equipment is unaffected).
When used against an object, the sphere disintegrates as much as one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter.
A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage.
If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is disintegrated.
The effects of the sphere count as a disintegrate spell for the purpose of destroying a wall of force or any other spell or effect specifically affected by disintegrate.
If the sphere exceeds the spell's range, it winks out.
Material Component: A pinch of dust from a disintegrated creature.
