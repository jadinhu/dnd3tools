This spell creates the illusion of one or more Small or Medium figures of a chosen humanoid race.
Each figure is effectively a minor image, and can appear dressed in any way the caster chooses.
When the spell is cast, each figure is given a brief set of orders to follow for the spell's duration, such as &quot;walk back and forth along that wall&quot; or &quot;stand by this gate&quot;.
The orders can be different for each figure.
These instructions can't be changed later.
The illusory figures can't speak or react to their surroundings ï¿½ ;they are typically used to scare off would-be intruders (as the spell's name suggests).
Material Component: A piece of charcoal.
