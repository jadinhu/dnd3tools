As you invoke the name of your deity, a towering, spectral image of the god appears above you, turning its wrath upon your foes.
You summon a looming illusion of the deity you worship, overlaid on your form.
The divine manifestation appears ghostly and fearsome, with its favored weapon drawn, and makes threatening overtures (roaring, spouting scripture, making dreadful threats, and the like).
The image is transparent enough that you receive no concealment.
Any enemy who can see the effect becomes shaken for 1 round.
A successful Will save negates the effect, and that creature can no longer be affected by this casting of the spell.
No creature can be affected more than once by the same casting of manifestation of the deity.
