You leach the power of the wand you hold, causing a ghostly stream of blue mist to rise from the item and enter your body.
Slowly, you feel your magical energies being renewed.
You drain the charges from a wand or staff you hold to replace spells you have already cast.
As long as the wand or staff has at least 5 charges left, you can expend 5 of those charges to replace a cast spell.
The spell replaced must be of a level equal to or lower than the highest-level spell the staff or wand holds.
If you prepare arcane spells, you can regain any one spell of the affected level that you have already cast that day; if you cast spells spontaneously, you can regain a spell slot of the appropriate level.
For example, a wizard who has cast her only fly spell for the day (a 3rd-level spell) can drain 5 charges from her wand of fireball (another 3rd-level spell) to regain fly or any lower-level spell she has cast.
If the wand or staff holds enough charges, one casting of this spell can replace multiple spells at once.
For example, a sorcerer who has expended three of his 5th-level spell slots can drain 15 charges from his staff of frost to regain all three spell slots.
Siphon has no effect on wands or staffs that do not hold enough charges to replenish the desired number of spells.
