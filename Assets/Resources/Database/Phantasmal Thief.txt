An invisible force, not unlike an unseen servant, comes into being where the caster wishes.
On the caster's turn, this force steals objects from others as she inaudibly directs it to (a free action).
A phantasmal thief can only steal from creatures.
It cannot break into locked chests or steal unattended objects.
A phantasmal thief has a Hide bonus of +20 (useful against those who can see invisible creatures) and a Move Silently bonus of +20.
If a phantasmal thief goes undetected, it can steal any object a creature possesses but is not carrying or wearing.
Even objects in a bag of holding can be stolen.
It can only steal objects, bring objects to the caster, or put them back where they came from.
It can take no other actions.
A phantasmal thief takes 1 round to steal an object and another round to bring it to the caster.
A phantasmal thief can only hold one object at a time; the object becomes invisible in the grasp of the phantasmal thief.
The phantasmal thief cannot take an item if the thief is detected by the creature it's trying to steal from (usually by a Listen or Spot check).
However, the thief, however, can repeat the attempt next round.
It cannot be harmed in any way, although it can be dispelled.
A phantasmal thief can also steal an object from a creature's hand.
It does this as if it had the Improved Disarm feat and a +20 Strength bonus.
If a phantasmal thief is used in this way, it disappears after it brings the stolen object to the caster.
Material Component: A spool of green thread.
