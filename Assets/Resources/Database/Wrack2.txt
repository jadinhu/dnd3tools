A humanoid subject of the spellcaster's choosing is wracked with such pain that he doubles over and collapses.
His face and hands blister and drip fluid, and the eyes cloud with blood, rendering him blind.
For the duration of the spell, the subject is considered helpless and cannot take actions.
Even when the spell ends, the subject is still visibly shaken and suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks for 3d10 minutes.
The subject's sight returns at the end of the spell's duration.
