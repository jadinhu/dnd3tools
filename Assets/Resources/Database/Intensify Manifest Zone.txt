<b>You reach forth into the essence of the manifested plane, pulling more of its power into the area.</b>
	
You enhance the effects of a manifest zone of a specified plane.
	
The effects of the manifest zone increase by one &quot;step.&quot; Since each zone is different, this can have various effects. A zone that exists in rings (such as the Gloaming in the Eldeen Reaches) has stronger effects as one moves inward; this spell increases the effect of a ring to that of the next inmost. The innermost ring of such a zone instead takes on one trait of the associated plane that it does not already have; in the case of the Gloaming again, the spell confers the mildly negative-dominant trait on that ring. A zone that has a uniform effect over its area takes on one planar trait (of your choice) in the same way.
	
You cannot further enhance a manifest zone (or a ring within a zone) with additional <b>intensify manifest zone</b> spells.
	
An <b>intensify manifest zone</b> effect cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a <b>limited wish</b>, <b>miracle</b>, <b>planar bubble</b>, or <b>wish</b> spell.
	
<b>Focus:</b> A gem, piece of precious metal, or concentrated essence of the plane associated with the manifest zone, worth at least 500 gp.
	
<b>XP Cost:</b> 500 XP.
