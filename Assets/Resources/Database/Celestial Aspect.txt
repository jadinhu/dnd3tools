The target can assume one of several celestial traits, chosen from selection below.
As a free action, the target can choose a different celestial trait, but the target cannot change traits more than once during a given round.
Armblade of the Sword Archon: One of the target's arms reshapes into a blade that functions as a +1 flaming longsword or +1 holy longsword (caster's choice).
The caster may also choose to create a short sword version instead of the normal longsword-sized blade.
The target cannot be holding anything in the affected arm, and the armblade cannot be disarmed or sundered.
Eyes of the Firre: Red flames fill the target's eyes.
Once per round, as a standard action, the target can deal 2d6 points of fire damage to any single creature or object within 60 feet, simply by gazing at it (no attack roll required).
Horns of the Cervidal: Ramlike horns sprout from the target's head.
The target can charge an opponent with its deadly horns.
In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this tactic allows the creature to make a single gore attack that deals 1d8 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times the target's Strength modifier.
Any summoned or called creature struck by the horns is dismissed instantly.
Wings of the Astral Deva: Angelic wings sprout from the target's back, allowing the target to fly at a speed of 100 feet (good).
Although these attributes change the target's appearance, other celestials do not recognize the target as a celestial being (unless the target happens to be one).
If the creature tries to disguise itself as a celestial, consult the Player's Handbook for the appropriate Disguise check DC.
Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Strength damage.
