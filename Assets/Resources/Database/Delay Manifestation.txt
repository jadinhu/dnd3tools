You prevent the subject creature from manifesting as a ghost for the duration of the spell.
If the subject dies, it appears on the Ethereal Plane as normal, but cannot enter the Material Plane while the spell is in effect.
This spell works only on an ethereal ghost or a living creature with a physical body; it cannot be cast upon the body of someone who is already dead, because this spell affects a creature's soul and a dead body has no soul to affect.
