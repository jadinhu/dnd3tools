An entomb spell traps living creatures in a block of ice, suffocating them.
The spell entraps the targets with a thick layer of ice from head to toe.
Those that make a successful Fortitude saving throw can shake off the ice immediately, though they still take 6d6 points of cold damage.
If the creature fails its saving throw, it is held within the ice and immediately begins to suffocate per the drowning rules (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
In addition, the creature takes 2d12 points of cold damage and 1 point of Constitution damage per round from contact
with the ice.
Other than attempting to escape, creatures entombed can perform actions that only require mental or verbal activity.
Escaping from the ice block requires a DC 20 Strength check or the application of 20 points of fire damage.
Material Component: A clear gemstone with a minimum value of 500 gp.
