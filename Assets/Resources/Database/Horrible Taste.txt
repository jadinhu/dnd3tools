Drawing upon the talents of some creatures of the insect world, you change your flesh to make it unpalatable to other creatures.
Any creature that hits you with a bite attack becomes nauseated until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.
Creatures immune to poison are unaffected by this spell.
