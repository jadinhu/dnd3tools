You sense through an animal's senses, seeing through its eyes, smelling through its nose, and hearing through its ears.
You use the animal's Listen and Spot skillmodifiers instead of your own.
This spell gives you no special ability to understand what you sense.
You can switch your perceptions between the animal and your own on your turn as a free action.
You and the animal must be on the same plane for the spell to function.
Material Component: An edible treat that would appeal to the animal (vegetable or meat).
