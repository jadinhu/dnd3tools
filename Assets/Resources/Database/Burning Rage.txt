As you imbue an ally with this spell, a nimbus of shimmering blue flame surrounds him.
He winces in pain as the flames scorch his flesh, but when the eldritch power flows into him, his muscles surge with might.
This spell imbues a creature with burning magical energy that enhances the subject's strength and endurance.
The searing energy also burns and injures the subject.
The subject of this spell gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, a +2 bonus on damage rolls, and damage reduction 2/magic.
This spell's burning energy deals 4 points of fire damage to the subject at the start of each of its turns until the spell's duration expires or you dismiss the effect.
