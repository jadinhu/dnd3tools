As you utter the final syllable, your foe's eyes roll up in her head.
She falls, snoring softly even as she hits the ground.
You put a single subject into a magically induced slumber that lasts indefinitely.
Normal stimuli, such as shouting or prodding, are insufficient to wake the subject, but any damage dealt to the subject causes her to rouse immediately.
The subject can attempt a new save every 24 hours to awaken early.
The subject does not need to eat or drink during this time.
Material Component: A pinch of black sand.
