You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into larger forms.
Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size.
The size to which the vermin can be grown depends on your level; see the table below.
The Monster Manual has game statistics for centipedes, spiders, and scorpions, as well as other kinds of vermin.
Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (&quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Defend&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot;, and so forth).
Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand.
Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.
The DM can extend this spell's effects to other kinds of insects, arachnids, or other vermin, such as ants, bees, beetles, praying mantises, and wasps, if he so chooses.
