The tentacles have 10-foot reach and are animate.
Each round as a free action, starting on the turn when you cast the spell, you can direct each tentacle to attack one opponent within reach.
The tentacles use your base attack bonus and Strength score, and each deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 points + your Str modifier.
The tentacles threaten the area within their reach, and each can make one attack of opportunity per round.
The tentacles also grant you a +4 bonus on Climb checks.
