The caster absorbs the life force and physical form from a living subject and uses it for himself.
The victim must be rendered helpless to cast this spell upon her.
For that day, the caster heals at twice the normal natural rate and does not need to eat.
The subject, on the other hand, does not heal naturally that day and takes 1 point of Constitution damage.
As long as the caster touches the subject once per day, he gains the benefits and the subject takes the Constitution damage.
If the caster does not touch the subject within 24 hours of the last time he touched her, the spell ends.
Villains often use this spell on prisoners, who are sometimes sustained by lesser restoration spells so they can serve for years as evil sustenance.
Location Component: An area under the effect of a desecrate or unhallow spell.
