You surround your hand or some other part of your body with light resembling moonlight.
You can change the intensity from a faint glow equivalent to a candle to a clear, bright light equivalent to a torch.
It varies in color as you desire, whether blue-white, soft green, white, or silver.
You can use this moonfire as a melee touch attack that deals 2d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
Whether or not the attack hits, the spell effect is discharged.
You can cause the moonlight to leave your body and move about as a single light similar to dancing lights.
Once it leaves your body, the effect's duration is 1 minute per level, and the effect can no longer be used to attack.
