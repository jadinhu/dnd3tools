This spell creates a disk of sunlike flames behind your head.
The flames give you resistance to cold 5.
In addition, if any creature strikes you with a natural attack, an unarmed strike, or a melee weapon that is not a reach weapon, it takes 1d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5) after dealing its normal damage to you.
This instantly discharges the spell.
If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.
Creatures wielding reach weapons, such as longspears, trigger this effect but are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
You can also use the spell to attack as if it were a touch spell (a successful hit discharges the spell).
