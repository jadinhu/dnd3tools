<b>You invoke the powers of nature, and a great fountain rises up before you, sending waves in all directions.</b>
	
Cold water gushes in a great wave outward from the point you choose, violently spreading to the limits of the area. This wave makes a bull rush attempt against each creature in the affected area without provoking attacks of opportunity. The wave has a +15 bonus on the opposed Strength check. If the wave wins the opposed Strength check, the defender is moved 5 feet directly away from the spell's point of origin, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 points by which the wave's check result exceeds that of the defender. Any creature moved 5 or more feet by rushing waters must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.
	
The wave also drenches anything in its area and extinguishes any normal fire as large as a bonfire.
