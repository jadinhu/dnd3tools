By pointing your figure at a favored enemy of yours, you mark it with a glowing rune that only you can see.
Your favored enemy bonuses against a foe with a mark of the hunter are +4 higher than they would otherwise be.
Furthermore, the rune limns your enemy, making him easier for you to attack.
The subject of a mark of the hunter gains no bonus to Armor Class against your attacks from any cover less than total cover, nor does it gain a miss chance against your attacks from any concealment less than total concealment.
Other effects that grant a miss chance (such as incorporealness) work normally.
Material Component: A bit of skin or bone from the relevant favored enemy type.
