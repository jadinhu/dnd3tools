You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose.
For example, you can make a stone weapon, a special trapdoor, or a crude idol.
Stone shape also permits you to reshape a stone door to make an exit where one didn't exist or to seal a door shut.
While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with stone shape, fine detail isn't possible.
There is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.
Arcane Material Component: Soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object and then touched to the stone while the verbal component is uttered.
