A wave of your hand sweeps away some of the magical effects on your target, but a surge of energy within you wants another try.
This spell functions as a targeted dispel magic.
If you cast tenacious dispelling again before the end of your next turn, the second casting can function either as a targeted or area dispel magic, and you gain a +2 bonus on dispel checks made as part of the spell.
