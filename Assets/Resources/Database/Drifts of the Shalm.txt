You call upon the power of Obad-Hai and conjure forth a great drift of snow, leaves, or smoldering ash.
Druids of Obad-Hai routinely evoke the drifts of their lord to delay their enemies, to buy themselves time in the face of a sudden threat, and simply to decorate their groves.
You create drifts of snow, leaves, or ash 3 feet thick.
It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a drift-covered square.
Additional effects apply based on the type of drift.
A snow drift ripples with freezing energy.
Anyone moving through or located in a snow drift takes 3 points of cold damage each round.
If any part of a leaf drift comes in contact with fire (anything from a torch to a fireball will do), the whole drift instantly ignites.
The heat from the burning leaves deals 2d6 points of fire damage to anyone in the inferno.
An ash drift smolders with dying embers.
Anyone moving through or located in an ash drift takes 3 points of fire damage each round.
