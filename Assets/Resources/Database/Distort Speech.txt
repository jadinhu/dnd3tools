You distort a creature's vocalizations.
The voice of the subject becomes warped and nearly incomprehensible.
For the duration of this spell, the subject has a 50% chance to miscast spells that have verbal components, and any time the subject speaks (including the use of magic items activated by command words), there is a 50% chance that the utterance is completely incomprehensible and therefore ineffective.
