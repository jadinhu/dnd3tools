You give the subject an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of some monsters.
This ability allows the creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.
For more details, see Scent in the introduction to the Monster Manual.
Arcane Material Component: A sprinkle of mustard and pepper, and a drop of sweat.
