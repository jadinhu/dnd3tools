<b>A touch from your hand, which sheds darkness like the blackest night, disrupts the life force of a living creature.</b>
	
Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and 1d6+2 points of Constitution damage. (A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the Constitution damage.)
	
The spell has a special effect on an undead creature. An undead touched by you takes no damage or Constitution loss, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds +1 round per caster level.
