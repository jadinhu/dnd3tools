You can sense the presence of the Shadowlands Taint.
The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject: 1st Round: Presence or absence of the Taint within the area.
2nd Round:Number of Tainted creatures in the area and the strength of the strongest Tainted aura present.
If you are free of Taint, the strongest Tainted aura is &quot;overwhelming&quot; (see below), and the strength of the Tainted aura is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell-like ability ends.
While stunned, you can't act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers gain a +2 bonus on attacks against you.
3rd Round: The strength and location of each Tainted aura.
If a Tainted aura is outside your line of sight, you discern its direction but not its exact location.
Aura Strength: The strength of a Tainted aura depends on the Taint score of the creature you are detecting.
(A Shadowlands creature has a Taint score equal to half its Charisma score, +1 for undead and +2 for outsiders, such as Shadowlands oni).
If an aura falls into more than one strength category, you learn the stronger of the two.
Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength:
Each round, you can turn to detect things in a new area.
The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
