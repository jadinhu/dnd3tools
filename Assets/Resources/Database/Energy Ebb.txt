<b>Energy Ebb</b>(Libris Mortis: The Book of the Dead)

Necromancy [Evil]

<b>Components:</b>
 <b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates; see text

 	
This spell functions like enervation (see page 226 of Player's Handbook), except the creature struck gains negative levels over an extended period.
You point your finger and utter the incantation, releasing a black needle of crackling negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes.
You must make a ranged touch attack to hit.
If the attack succeeds, the subject initially gains one negative level, then continues to gain another negative level each round thereafter as her life force slowly bleeds away.
The drain can only be stopped by a successful Heal check (DC 23) or the application of a heal, restoration or greater restoration spell.
If the black needle strikes an undead creature, that creature gains 4d4x;5 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.
