While underwater, the subject functions as if affected by <b>blur</b> (<b>PH</b> 206), <b>freedom of movement</b> (<b>PH</b> 233), and <b>water breathing</b> (<b>PH</b> 300),and doesn't take nonlethal damage for the duration of the spell. When out of the water (or even partially out), the subject gains none of these advantages except water breathing. The subject can leave and reenter water without ending the spell.
