This spell alerts all wearers of a specific insignia (see below) within range.
Such creatures hear a single mental &quot;ping&quot; (as the alarm spell, page 197 of the Player's Handbook) when this spell is cast.
This spell requires significant preparation.
Before using this spell you must forge specially crafted insignias.
These can be crafted in the form of amulets, badges, rings, or any similar object, but each one must bear the same logo, crest, or symbol.
Each insignia costs 10 gp.
Militias, guilds, or churches within a city use this spell to call all its members together.
Focus: A specially prepared insignia (see above).
