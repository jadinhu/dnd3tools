You bestow a dreadful affliction on the creature you touch, similar to the effect of an aboleth's foul contact.
	
The skin of the target creature transforms into a transparent, glistening membrane. A creature so transformed must keep this membrane moistened with cool, fresh water or take 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. In addition, its natural armor bonus (if any) decreases by 1, but it can never drop below 0.
	
This transformation does not affect natural armor bonuses provided by magic items. This curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse spell if cast within 24 hours. Afterward, only a heal, mass heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell can remove the affliction.
