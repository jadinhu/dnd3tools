You conjure a wraithlike, faintly glowing cloud of white vapor that coalesces into a disembodied dragon's claw made of ice.
This spell creates a Medium four-taloned claw about 5 feet long.
The icy claw has a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability), hit points equal to your full normal total, saving throw bonuses equal to your own, and AC 25 (+10 Dex, +5 natural).
It has damage reduction 15/magic and bludgeoning and is immune to cold, poison, critical hits, and magical effects that don't deal damage.
It takes half again as much damage (+50%) from fire.
An icy claw never provokes attacks of opportunity.
It cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field, but it is affected by prismatic wall or prismatic sphere.
A disintegrate spell or a successful dispel magic destroys it.
An icy claw attacks an opponent of your choice once per round, and its attack bonus equals your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for a wizard or sorcerer, respectively) +10 for the claw's Strength score (31).
An icy claw deals 1d6+15 points of damage plus 3d6 points of cold damage.
If it successfully damages a Medium or smaller foe, it attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, with a grapple check bonus equal to your caster level +10.
On a successful grapple check, an icy claw deals normal damage (see above).
The claw ignores effects intended to mask or conceal the selected target, including darkness, invisibility, displacement, hiding in plain sight, and the like.
Directing an icy claw to a new target is a free action.
Arcane Focus: A white dragon's talon.
