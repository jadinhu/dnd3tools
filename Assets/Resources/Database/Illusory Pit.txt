You create an illusory pit, and each creature entering or within the area is forced to make a Will save or believe the floor on which it stands has become a bottomless chasm.
On a successful save, creatures suffer a mild case of vertigo and are stunned for 1 round, but those that fail their saves fall prone and are unable to take any action except clawing desperately at the floor in the hopes of stopping their apparent fall.
An attack on an affected creature frees it from the effect of the illusion but leaves it stunned for 1 round.
Likewise, when the spell ends, creatures that believed they were falling are stunned for 1 round.
Flying creatures passing over an illusory pit that succeed on a Will save are unaffected by the spell, but those that fail are stunned for 1 round.
