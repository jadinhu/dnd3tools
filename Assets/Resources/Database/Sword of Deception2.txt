A blade made of pale green force appears and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it.
It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter.
It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so, for example, it can strike incorporeal creatures.
The blade attacks with the base attack bonus of a fighter whose level is equal to your caster level, and it deals 1d4 points of damage per hit.
It threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 and deals double damage with a critical hit.
In addition, each hit on a single creature inflicts a -1 luck penalty on that creature's next saving throw roll (-2 with a critical hit).
Successive hits increase this penalty, to a maximum of -5 on a single creature.
This saving throw penalty lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation.
Remove curse and similar spells can cancel the penalty.
The weapon always strikes from your direction.
It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.
Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon.
If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the weapon to a new target.
If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target.
On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack (as it does in the round when the spell is cast).
Subsequent rounds of attacking the same target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if its base attack bonus would allow it to.
The sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged.
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the sword of deception strikes it.
If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled.
If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
Focus: A miniature replica of a sword and a set of loaded dice.
