You create gaseous pads of cloudstuff on the subject's feet, allowing them to walk on the clouds.
These pads allow each subject to move straight up or down at a speed of up to 30 feet or laterally with a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability), as desired.
(Lateral movement is possible only for a subject who is already at least 90 feet off the ground).
To touch the earth again, a subject must use a standard action to shake off the cloudstuff, which ends the spell for that creature.
You may dismiss the spell, but only for all subjects at once ï¿½ ;an act that can have significant consequences for subjects already in the air.
