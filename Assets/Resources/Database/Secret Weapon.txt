At your touch, the weapon seems to disappear from view.
You enable someone to hide a weapon on his person.
The weapon does not become truly invisible so much as easily overlooked.
Secret weapon adds +20 to the Sleight of Hand check to conceal a light weapon, and +10 to the check to conceal a larger weapon (even one normally too large to conceal).
A &quot;weapon&quot; is defined as any manufactured weapon.
With the aid of this spell, you can attempt to hide a weapon even if you do not possess the Sleight of Hand skill.
Additionally, you can hide the presence of a weapon from detection spells, although true seeing penetrates the glamer.
Material Component: A thin black cloth.
