By means of this spell you draw a visible, unholy &quot;line in the sand&quot; that causes a feeling of dread and hesitation in all creatures that cross it.
Any creature entering the affected area must make a Will save or become shaken.
A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same spellcaster's battle line spells for 24 hours.
