<b>You blast a nearby creature with a multicolored ray. The ray explodes on contact to form a dizzying array of bizarre swirling and flashing lights around the targeted creature.</b>
	
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. This ray attempts to undo magic as it is being cast. Used in the same manner as a counterspell (as a readied action), the ray interferes with the manipulation of divine or arcane magic by dazzling the target. If the ray successfully strikes a spellcaster, and that spellcaster is in the process of casting a spell, then the target spellcaster must make a Concentration check to avoid losing the spell. The DC of the Concentration check is equal to 17 + the level of the spell the target is casting.
