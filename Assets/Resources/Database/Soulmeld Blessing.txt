When you cast soulmeld blessing, you provide each affected creature with a surfeit of essentia.
Affected creatures can immediately reallocate their essentia pool as if they had taken a swift action to do so (even though it isn't their turn and no action is required).
Essentia that cannot be reallocated with a swift action (for example, essentia invested in an incarnum feat) cannot be redistributed.
