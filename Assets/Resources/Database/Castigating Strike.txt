<b>With a howling battle cry, your weapon crackles with energy. As you strike your foe, that energy detonates in a burst that scythes through those who stand against your cause.</b>
	
When you use this strike, make a single melee attack. If you hit your opponent and his alignment has at least one component different from yours, a blast of divine energy originates from your attack?s point of impact. The target of this strike takes an extra 8d6 points of damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 17 + your Cha modifier) or take a ?2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 minute. 
	
All of your opponents within a 30-foot-radius burst of the target creature must also succeed on a Fortitude save. Those who fail take 5d6 points of damage and take a ?2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 minute. A successful save results in half damage and negates the attack penalty.<
