Anyone caught in the area of this spell suffers excruciating pain and becomes demoralized.
Each creature takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (up to a maximum of 15d4) and becomes panicked for 1 round per caster level.
A successful Will save halves the damage, reduces the panicked effect to shaken, and reduces the duration of the shaken effect to 1 round.
