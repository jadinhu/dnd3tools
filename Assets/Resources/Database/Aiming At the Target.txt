When you cast this spell as a swift action (see page 86), you increase your ability to concentrate on a spell you have already cast.
This spell is one of only a few spells (finding the center being another) that you can cast while maintaining concentration on another spell.
Aiming at the target gives you a +10 circumstance bonus on Concentration checks you make to maintain concentration on the other spell, and its effect lasts as long as you concentrate on the other spell (to a maximum of 20 minutes).
