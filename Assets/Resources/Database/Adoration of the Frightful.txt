A thunderous rumble echoes from within you, washing over cowed creatures and forcing them to show you respect.
	
Upon casting this spell, you radiate a magical aura that causes fearful creatures to shy away from harming you. While this spell is in effect, any creature within the spell's area that is shaken, frightened, or panicked has its attitude toward you shifted to friendly (see Influencing <span class="caps">NPC</span> Attitudes, PH 72).
	
This effect ends for a given creature if the fear effect is removed, or if you or an ally attacks the creature or otherwise takes any hostile act toward it.
	
Special: A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks.
