This spell transforms a quantity of ice into a long, deadly lance, which is then magically propelled at a target you designate.
You must succeed on a ranged attack to strike a target.
A +4 bonus applies to your attack roll.
If you hit, the icelance deals 5d6 points of damage to the target.
Half of this damage is piercing damage; the rest is cold damage.
In addition, the target must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.
Regardless of the result of the attack, the icelance shatters upon its first use.
Material Component: At least 10 pounds of ice or snow.
Most mages cast this spell in an area with natural ice or snow, but in a pinch the ice left over from an ice storm spell will suffice.
