Remaining utterly still for a moment, you clench your fist and speak words of such potency that the creature you name simply ceases to exist.
There's no fire, no flash, and no corpse.
It's as if the creature you named never existed in the first place.
With this most powerful of spells, you erase a subject's truename from existence itself.
The last thing the subject ever hears is your voice uttering its truename ï¿½ ;then nothing but oblivion.
Items worn, held, or carried by the creature are likewise obliterated with no save allowed.
Creatures killed with an unname spell are difficult to restore to life (see The Unnamed sidebar).
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak the personal truename of the creature you're trying to erase from reality.
