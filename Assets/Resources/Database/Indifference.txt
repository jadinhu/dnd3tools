This spell drains emotion from the creature touched.
The subject becomes immune to fear and compulsion effects of 2nd level or lower and gains a +4 circumstance modifier on saving throws against fear or compulsion effects of 3rd level or higher.
Furthermore, morale bonuses or penalties do not affect the subject while the spell lasts.
However, the subject's lack of emotion imposes a -4 circumstance penalty on Charisma checks.
If the subject already is under a fear or compulsion effect when receiving this spell, a failed saving throw ends that effect and leaves the subject dazed for 1 round.
Material Component: A small stone.
