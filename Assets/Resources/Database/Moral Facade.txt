With an uttered incantation and a motion of your hand, you surround your target with a haze that prevents others from discerning its true nature.
By casting this spell, you cloak the target in an effect that gives a false alignment reading to all divination spells.
At the time of casting, you must designate the alignment that you wish the spell to reveal.
