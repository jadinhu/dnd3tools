You enspell a garment or container so that it provides a safe haven for your familiar.
The spell turns one of the target item's pockets into an extradimensional space that can hold your familiar (or about 1 cubic foot for a Tiny or smaller creature).
The familiar fits inside without creating a noticeable bulge in the item.
Whenever the familiar is touching you, you can whisk it inside the pocket as a free action by speaking a command word.
If the familiar can speak, it can command itself inside.
The familiar can leave the space as a free action, or you can call it forth as a free action.
Once inside, the familiar has total cover and concealment.
You or the familiar can seal the pocket, making it airtight and waterproof.
The air supply inside the sealed pocket lasts an hour.
With the pocket open, the familiar can remain inside indefinitely.
If the spell ends with the familiar inside the pocket, it appears in your space, unharmed unless the area you occupy is hazardous.
Creating an extradimensional space within or taking an extradimensional space into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous.
Material Components: A tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth given a half-twist and fastened at the ends.
