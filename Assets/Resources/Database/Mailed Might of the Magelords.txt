You create a translucent, protective field of force (+8 armor bonus) around the subject.
In addition, the subject becomes immune to 2nd-level or lower spells with the force descriptor and gains damage reduction 5/magic.
Unlike mundane armor, the force armor created by mailed might of the magelords has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance, and it mandates no speed reduction.
Furthermore, since the armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
Arcane Material Component: A miniature adamantine shield worth at least 250 gp.
