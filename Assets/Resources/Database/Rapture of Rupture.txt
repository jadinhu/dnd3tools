With this spell, the caster's touch deals grievous wounds to multiple targets.
After rapture of rupture is cast, the caster can touch one target per round until she has touched a number of targets equal to her caster level.
The same creature cannot be affected twice by the same rapture of rupture.
A creature with no discernible anatomy is unaffected by this spell.
When the caster touches a subject, his flesh bursts open suddenly in multiple places.
Each subject takes 6d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round; a successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half and negates the stun effect.
Subjects who fail their Fortitude save continue to take 1d6 points of damage per round until they receive magical healing, succeed at a Heal check (DC 20), or die.
If a subject takes 6 points of damage from rapture of rupture in a single round, he is stunned in the following round.
Corruption Cost: 1 point of Strength damage per target touched.
