You create an unmoving, transparent sphere of force centered on you.
The interior of the sphere and everything within 5 feet of its edge is illuminated with light equivalent to that of a candle.
You and your allies may enter the sphere at will.
Any other creature that tries to enter must make a Will saving throw to succeed.
Any creature may leave the sphere freely, but a creature that has left must make a successful Will save to enter again, even if it is you or one of your allies.
Creatures within the area of the sphere at the time of casting are not forced out.
While in the area of the forceward, you and your allies each gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against effects created by evil creatures.
Creatures within the area that are not your allies gain no benefit.
The forceward does not prevent spells or objects from entering the area, so it is possible for two creatures on opposite sides of the sphere's edge to fight without penalties.
A creature using unarmed attacks or natural weapons in this manner, however, must still make a Will save each round, or its attacks cannot pass the forceward's boundary.
