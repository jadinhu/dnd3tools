As a free action, you can launch one star per round at a target your designate within range.
Alternatively, as a standard action, you may launch up to three stars per round at one or more targets within range.
Each star requires its own ranged touch attack roll.
A nonevil target takes 1d8 points of damage, half of which is nonlethal (round down).
Evil targets take 1d8 points of lethal damage instead.
