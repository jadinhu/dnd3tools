This spell grants Intelligence to mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies.
Undead with Intelligence scores are unaffected.
Each mindless undead creature within the radius gains an Intelligence score of 1d6+4.
A subject of the spell cannot gain a higher Intelligence than is typical for its original kind.
A skeletal dog simply has Intelligence 2, while a skeletal orc uses the 1d6+4 die roll but can't have a score higher than 8.
Awakened undead do not regain any skills, feats, or extraordinary abilities they had in life, but they do gain skill points ([4 + Int mod] x HD)and feats (one for first Hit Die, one for each three HD thereafter) normally after being awakened.
Undead regain the armor and weapon proficiencies they had in life (assume the undead were formerly <span class="caps">NPC</span> warriors unless your DM specifies otherwise) and will don armor and take up weapons while obeying your commands.
A zombie fighter can wear any armor and wield any simple or martial weapon, while a zombie warhorse can wear any armor.
Awakened undead gain a +2 profane bonus on their Will saving throws to resist being controlled.
Material Component: A humanoid fingerbone.
XP Cost: 200 XP.
