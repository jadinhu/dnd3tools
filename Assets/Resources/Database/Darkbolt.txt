The caster makes a ranged touch attack against a foe, launching a bolt of cold darkness from his left hand.
The bolt deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8).
Half the damage is cold, and the other has no specific type.
When struck, the foe must also succeed at a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round, overwhelmed by the evil charge of the darkbolt.
