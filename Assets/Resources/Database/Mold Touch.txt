You cause a 5-foot-diameter patch of brown mold to appear, centered on the point you touch.
You can cause it to appear on a living target by making a successful melee touch attack against that creature.
As described on page 76 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, every living creature within 5 feet of the brown mold takes 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage each round.
Fire brought within 5 feet of the patch instantly doubles its size, and cold damage instantly destroys it.
