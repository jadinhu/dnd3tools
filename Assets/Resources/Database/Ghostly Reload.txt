Shimmering ghostly hands pull your crossbow's string back into the catch as you prepare to fire another bolt.
After the wielder shoots a projectile from the crossbow affected by this spell, the magic immediately cocks the crossbow so that the weapon can be loaded again.
Ghostly reload pulls the string of a hand crossbow or light crossbow into place once per caster level (maximum ten times at caster level 10th) and the string of a heavy crossbow into place once per two caster levels (maximum five times at caster level 10th).
Cumulative castings of ghostly reload do not stack.
This spell allows the crossbow's wielder to fire a light crossbow or heavy crossbow as a standard action and move in the same round.
If the character benefits from a high base attack bonus, the crossbow can be fired multiple times as a full attack, but only if ghostly reload can be applied to each attack in that round.
Focus: A crossbow.
