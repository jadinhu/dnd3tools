Shield creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you.
It negates magic missile attacks directed at you.
The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC.
This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect.
The shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.
Unlike with a normal tower shield, you can't use the shield spell for cover.
