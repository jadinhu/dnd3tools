With this spell, you become an unerring tracker, instantly aware of your quarry's location whenever it's on the move.
The implacable pursuer spell gives you the direction and distance to the target creature whenever it finishes a turn more than 10 feet away from where it started.
The difficulty of the save against implacable pursuer depends on your relationship to the subject.
You apply your favored enemy bonus (if any) to the DC of the Will save the target attempts.
Once you successfully target a creature with implacable pursuer, you'll know its location as long as it's moving, no matter where it goes on the same plane.
Even if it leaves the plane, implacable pursuer tells you what plane the target creature went to.
The spell then provides no further information until you and the subject creature are on the same plane, in which case implacable pursuer resumes functioning normally.
