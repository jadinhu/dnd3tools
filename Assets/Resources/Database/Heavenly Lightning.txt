You create a leaping bolt of radiant lightning that arcs from one target to the next, avoiding other creatures in its path.
Each target struck by an arc takes 3d6 points of special celestial electricity damage.
Creatures normally immune to electricity take full damage from this spell, and the celestial lightning is not subject to being reduced by protection from energy (electricity) or similar magic.
