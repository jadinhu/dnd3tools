<b>The complicated gestures of the spell end with a punch of your fist, which now has the texture and look of stone.</b>
	
You transform one of your hands into a mighty fist of living stone, gaining a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength for the purpose of attack rolls, grapple checks or breaking and crushing items. In addition, you gain the ability to make one natural slam attack, dealing 1d6 points of damage + your new Strength bonus (or 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus if you make no other attacks in that round). You can make the slam attack as a natural secondary attack, with the normal -5 penalty, or a -2 penalty if you have the Multiattack feat (<b>MM</b> 304), as part of a full attack action. However, you cannot gain more than one slam attack per round with this spell due to a high base attack bonus (+6 or higher).
	
Your fist undergoes no change in size or form, remaining as flexible and responsive as it would normally be while under the spell's effect.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A pebble inscribed with a stylized fist design.
