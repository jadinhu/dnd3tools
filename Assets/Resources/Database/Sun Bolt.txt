A ray of burning sunlight springs from your hand.
You must make a ranged touch attack to hit your target.
A creature struck by the bolt is blinded for 1 round and takes 2d6 points of damage.
Creatures harmed by sunlight take double damage.
Undead always take double damage, as do fungi, molds, oozes, and slimes; undead damaged by sunlight (such as vampires) always take triple damage.
A successful Reflex save negates the blindness.
