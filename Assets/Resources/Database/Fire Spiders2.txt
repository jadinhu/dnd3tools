<b>Tiny lights appear in the darkness &#8211; one, then, over a hundred. As they appear, the sound of insectile chittering increases, until a swarming army of flaming, otherworldly arachnids is gathered together at your command.</b>
	
You call forth a teeming mass of fire elementals the size of common spiders. A creature that starts its turn in the affected area takes 4d6 points of fire damage. Each round, you can use a move action to direct the spiders to move up to 30 feet. If the spiders are left undirected, they move at speed of 15 feet toward the nearest living creature, if one isn't already in the affected area.
	
As fire elementals, the fire spiders have immunity to fire and are thwarted by barriers that block neutral outsiders. Any cold spell of 3rd level or higher can disperse the fire spiders, ending the spell.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A pinch of sulfur.
