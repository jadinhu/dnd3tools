Hissing and whispering softly, you stir feelings of confusion and madness in the targets'minds.
You can choose to inflict one of the following conditions upon any creatures that fail their saving throws.
Hysteria: The subjects fall into fits of uncontrollable laughing or crying (equal chance for either).
Hysterical creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention.
The only action such a character can take is a single move action per turn.
Panic: The subjects become panicked.
If cornered, a panicked creature cowers.
Violent Hallucinations: The subjects perceive any nearby creatures as dangerous enemies, attacking the nearest ones and fighting until the subjects are slain or until no more creatures are in sight.
Stupor: The subjects curl up on the floor and remain oblivious to events around them.
Characters in a stupor are effectively stunned and prone.
Maddening whispers has no effect upon creatures that can see you, creatures that have already rolled saving throws against your frightful presence, or unconscious creatures.
