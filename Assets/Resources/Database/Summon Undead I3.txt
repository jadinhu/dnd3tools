This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you summon an undead creature.
Summon undead I conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the Summon Undead table.
You choose which creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.
Summoned undead do not count toward the total Hit Dice of undead that you can control with animate dead or the other command undead abilities.
Focus: A tiny bag, a small (not lit) candle, and a carved bone from any humanoid.
