Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel the subjects to do nothing but watch you.
Animals trained to attack or guard, dire animals, legendary animals, beasts, and magical beasts are entitled to saving throws; normal animals are not.
An affected creature can be struck (with a +2 bonus on the attack roll, as if it were stunned), but such an action breaks the spell on that creature.
