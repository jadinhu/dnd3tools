You conjure into existence a fine, seaworthy ship to carry you and your companions safely and comfortably.
A caravel is a fairly small, double-decked sailing ship (see page 98 for more information).
It holds a generous amount of cargo and offers cramped quarters for crew and passengers.
The ship produced by this spell has even more room for cargo and passengers, contained within an extradimensional space.
The entry point to this space is a hatch on the aft upper deck.
Lifting the hatch reveals a set of wooden stairs, which descend about 6 feet to a horizontal shimmering in the air about 4 feet wide.
Only those you designate can enter this space, and the extradimensional portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter.
Those without authorization to enter instead continue descending the steps to an ordinary cargo hold.
You can open the portal again from your own side at will.
Those who pass beyond the portal's entrance find themselves in a magnificent foyer with many staterooms whose doors open from this space.
The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
You can create any deck plan you desire within the limit of the spell's effect.
The cabins are furnished, and the galley contains sufficient foodstuffs and preparation equipment to serve three full meals per day per person per caster level.
A staff of near-transparent pursers (up to two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter.
They function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere within the extradimensional space.
Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the passenger space, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.
Bad weather or other marine hazards can still threaten the vessel, but even if it sinks, the passenger space remains safe and isolated (though exiting it might prove difficult).
The ship is crewed by a minimum complement of spectral deckhands, which perform the basic tasks of maintenance.
These, like the cabin servants, behave as unseen servants but can travel anywhere on board ship and can enter the extradimensional space if you so direct.
The spectral deckhands respond to the direction of the helmsman, reducing the number of crew necessary to control the caravel to 1.
If you do not provide a real helmsman, the ship will steer itself on the last course a living helmsman provided but will not be able to avoid collisions or hazards or adjust to changing conditions.
Focus: A miniature ship carved from mahogany, rigged with silk sails and gold thread, with a total value of 500 gp.
