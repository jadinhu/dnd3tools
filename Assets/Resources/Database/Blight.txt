This spell has two versions.
To cast either version, you must touch a plant and breathe on it.
Blight Area:When the spell is cast on a single normal plant, all normal plants in a 100-foot spread wither and die.
Flowers wilt, leaves fall to the ground, and foliage withers.
The spell has no effect on the soil, so new growth can replace the dead plants.
This effect allows no saving throw.
Blight Plant Creature:When cast on a single mobile or intelligent plant, such as a shambling mound or a treant, this spell deals 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 15d6.
The plant receives a Fortitude save for half damage.
