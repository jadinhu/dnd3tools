<b>The eternal energies of light and darkness you call upon to cast this spell cause the ambient light near you to coalesce around the crystal rod in your hand. The light erupts in a coruscating beam of radiance shaped like a needle-sharp lance.</b>
	
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A creature struck is blinded for 1 round, and dazzled for 1 round per caster level. A creature sensitive to bright light (such as a drow, duergar, or kuo-toa) takes penalties as if it had been exposed to full daylight for 1 round if struck by the beam, even if it resists the spell's other effects.
	
In addition to this dazzling effect, lucent lance deals damage based on the level of light available within your square. In bright light, it deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). In shadowy illumination, it deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4). If no light is present in your square, the spell cannot be cast at all.
	
Focus: A clear glass or crystal rod.
