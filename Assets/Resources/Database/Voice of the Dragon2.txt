<b>Voice of the Dragon</b>(Spell Compendium, p. 232)

Transmutation
 <b>Level:</b>  Bard 4,  Sorcerer 4,  Wizard 4,   Dragon 4,   
<b>Components:</b>V, S, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Personal
 <b>Target:</b> You
 <b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes/level (D)

 	
<b>As you speak the words of the spell and inscribe the motions in the air, your voice deepens, taking on a resonance that makes the listener think of authority, power, and great age.</b>
	
You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. You also gain the ability to speak and understand (but not read) Draconic.
	
At any time before the spell's duration expires, you can use a standard action to target a creature with a <b>suggestion</b> effect, which functions identically to the spell of that name (<b>PH</b> 285), including range, duration, and other effects. Doing this causes the <b>voice of the dragon</b> spell to end, though the <b>suggestion</b> itself lasts for the normal duration thereafter.
	
<b>Special:</b> Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.
