You blast the target with loud and high-pitched sounds.
Horizikaul's boom strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee or has anything less than total cover or concealment.
The target takes 1d4 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (minimum 1d4, maximum 5d4) and must make a Will save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds.
This spell has no effect if cast into the area of a silence spell.
