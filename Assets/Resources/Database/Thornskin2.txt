When you cast this spell, you become so completely attuned to the element of wood that your skin sprouts thorns all over.
These thorns do not damage you, but they both increase the damage you can deal with an unarmed attack and make you a dangerous person to grab.
When you make a successful unarmed attack, you deal 1d6 points of normal, not subdual, piercing damage.
If you already deal extra damage, because you are a multiclassed monk or for any other reason, your damage increases by one die type: 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, 1d10 to 1d12, 1d12 to 1d20, 1d20 to 2d12.
If you have another form of natural attack, such as a claw attack, use 1d6 or your claw damage, whichever is better.
A creature that hits you with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, including an attempt to grapple, takes 1d4 points of piercing damage.
Material Component: A thorn.
