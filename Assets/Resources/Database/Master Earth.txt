<b>Master Earth</b>(Magic of Faerun)

Transmutation
 <b>Level:</b>  Druid 7,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, AF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action
 <b>Range:</b> Personal
 <b>Target:</b> You
 <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous

 	
You travel straight through the earth itself to a destination you choose.
The movement is instantaneous and has no distance limitations (though the location must be on the same world).
You need only think of where you want to go.
If you don't think of an exact location, the earth carries you to the periphery of the general area you imagine.
For example, if you want to go to the Shining Plains but you can't remember any specific landmarks, the earth brings you back on the surface at the nearest edge of the Shining Plains.
The earth never leaves you stranded inside it.
It always puts you back on the surface even if it cannot deliver you to your chosen destination.
It takes you as far as it can.
Underground, creature-built structures don't hinder you as long as you can move around them.
This spell only functions on the Material Plane.
Focus: The fossil of any animal.
