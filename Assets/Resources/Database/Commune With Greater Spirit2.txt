As commune with lesser spirit, but this spell can contact any spirit creature, whatever its Hit Dice.
You can ask one question per level, but you must ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no.
The answers given are correct within the limits of the spirit's knowledge.
&quot;Unclear&quot; is a legitimate answer, because even the greatest spirits are not necessarily omniscient.
In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the spirit's interests, the DM should give a short phrase (five words or less) as an answer instead.
Material Component: Incense and a small offering worth 25 gp.
XP Cost: 100 XP.
