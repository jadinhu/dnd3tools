This spell protects one creature from a single 1st- or 2nd-level spell. The creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the chosen spell. Lesser spell immunity can't protect a creature from a spell to which spell resistance doesn't apply. This spell works against other spells, spell-like effects, and innate spell-like abilities. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a school of spells or a group of spells with similar effects; thus, a creature given immunity to inflict light wounds is still susceptible to inflict moderate wounds.
	
A creature can have only one lesser spell immunity or <b>spell immunity</b> (PH 282) in effect at a time.
