You shoot a ray of necromantic energy from your outstretched hand, causing any living creature struck by the ray to violently purge blood vessels through its skin.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to touch the subject.
If the touch attack is successful, the subject loses half its hit points (rounded down) and is stunned for 1 round.
On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not stunned.
The purged blood vessels are magically animate, creating a many-layered mass of magically strong, adhesive tissue that trap those caught in them.
The avascular mass instantaneously erupts from the target, and must be anchored on last least two opposed points � ;
such as floor and ceiling or opposite walls � ;or else the mass collapses and has no effect.
Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius avascular mass become entangled.
The original target of the spell is automatically entangled.
An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, a &#8211; 4 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can't move.
An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check or lose the spell.
Because the avascular mass is magically animate, and gradually tightens on those it holds, the Concentration check DC is 30.
Anyone within 20 feet of the primary target when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save.
If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the avascular mass and is free to act, though moving may be a problem (see below).
If the save fails, the creature is stuck.
A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 30 Escape Artist check.
Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature may progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly.
Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check.
The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
If you have at least 5 feet of avascular mass between you and an opponent, it provides cover.
If you have at least 20 feet of avascular mass between you, it provides total cover.
When the secondary duration elapses, the blood vessel mass becomes only so much limp, decaying tissue.
