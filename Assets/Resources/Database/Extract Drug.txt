The caster infuses a substance with energy and creates a magical version of a drug.
The magical version manifests as greenish fumes that rise from the chosen focus.
The fumes must then be inhaled as a standard action within 1 round to get the drug's effects.
The type of drug extracted depends on the substance used.
There may be other drugs that can be extracted with rarer substances, at the DM's discretion.
Focus: 15 lb. or 1 cubic foot of the material in question.
