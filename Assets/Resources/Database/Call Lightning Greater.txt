This spell is similar to call lightning, except that you may call down bolts every 5 minutes.
To cast greater call lightning, you must be in a stormy area � ;a rain shower, a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinn or air elemental of 7 HD or more), clouds and wind, or even hot and cloudy conditions will do.
While you are in such an area, you can call down one bolt of lightning every 5 minutes.
You need not do so immediately upon casting � ;other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed at any time during the spell's duration.
However, you must use a standard action to concentrate on the spell when you call each bolt.
Each bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke, striking any target point you designate that is within range (measured from your position at the time).
It takes the shortest possible unobstructed path between a nearby cloud and the target point.
Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the bolt's path or the point where it strikes is affected.
Each bolt deals 1d10 points of electrical damage per caster level (maximum 15d10).
Greater call lightning is usable only outdoors; it does not function indoors, underground, or underwater.
The spell ends if you leave the stormy area.
