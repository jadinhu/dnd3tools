<b>Even when you are trapped in tight quarters and seemingly unable to move, a leap can send you flying gracefully through the air.</b>
	
The Tiger Claw discipline teaches you to assume a stance that allows you to sail through the air when jumping. You spring from the ground with an unmatched burst of speed and strength.
	
While you are in this stance, you gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus on Jump checks. In addition, any jumps you make while in this stance are considered running jumps.
