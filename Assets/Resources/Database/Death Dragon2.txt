<b>Death Dragon</b>(Magic of Faerun)

Necromancy [Evil, Fear, Mind-Affecting]
 <b>Level:</b>  Cleric 7,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, DF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 full round
 <b>Range:</b> Personal
 <b>Effect:</b> Dragon of energy and bones
 <b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)

 	
You summon unholy power to gird yourself in a dragon-shaped cocoon of bones and negative energy.
The cocoon gives you a +4 natural armor bonus and a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class, plus 1 temporary hit point per caster level (maximum +20).
You are treated as armed when you make unarmed attacks, and deal damage as if your limbs were short swords.
You can use your off hand to attack, incurring the standard two-weapon fighting penalties (see Table 8-2, page 125 of the Player's Handbook).
The death dragon prevents you from casting spells with somatic, material, or focus (but not divine focus) components, but does not otherwise hinder your actions or movement.
As a standard action, you may project a cone of fear or make a melee touch attack to use inflict critical wounds on the creature touched.
