Cold water gushes in a great wave outward from the point you choose, violently spreading to the limits of the area.
This wave attempts a bull rush against each creature in the affected area without provoking attacks of opportunity.
For the purpose of the opposed Strength check, the wave is Colossal, has a Strength score of 34, and is considered to be charging and moving with the affected creatures (total bonus +30).
If the wave wins the opposed Strength check, the defender is moved 5 feet directly away from the spell's point of origin, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 points by which the wave's check result exceeds that of the defender.
Any creature moved 5 or more feet by rushing waters must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.
The wave also drenches anything in its area and extinguishes any normal fire as large as a bonfire.
