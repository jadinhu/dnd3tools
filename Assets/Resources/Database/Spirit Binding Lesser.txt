This spell functions as lesser planar binding (see page 262 of the Player's Handbook), except that it allows you to call and trap a single spirit creature of up to 8 Hit Dice.
When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.
