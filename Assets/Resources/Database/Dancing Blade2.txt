When you cast this spell, you cause the target sword to hover and fight in the air, defending the character you designate.
The sword must be either unattended or in the possession of the willing ally who will benefit from the spell.
The sword fights using that character's base attack bonus and its base damage, with no adjustment for Strength or other ability scores.
If the character is not proficient with the sword, the sword suffers a -4 penalty on its attack rolls.
The sword stays within 5 feet of the character you designate, and drops to the ground if that character is dying or dead.
Controlling the sword requires no concentration, and the character can fight with another weapon at the same time.
The dancing blade prevents two opponents from receiving a flanking bonus against the character, though additional opponents can still gain a flanking bonus.
Material Component: A tiny stick puppet.
