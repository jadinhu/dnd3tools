You entire body sparkles as color fades from your form.
A stiff breeze picks up as you collapse into thousands of particles of sand, sent flying on the warm wind.
You and all your belongings become a flying cloud of sand, swirling and formless yet retaining your consciousness.
You lose your normal shape and become a sand cloud, taking up the same space you do in your normal form.
You can fly at a speed of 40 feet (perfect maneuverability), but you lose any other movement rates you had in your normal form.
Treat this otherwise as gaseous form (PH 234).
If you end your movement in the same space as another creature, that creature is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates).
Spell resistance does not apply against this effect.
Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a
gust of wind effect (as the spell) as a swift action.
Doing so ends the duration of passage of the shifting sands.
Special: A blue dragon capable of casting 6th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
