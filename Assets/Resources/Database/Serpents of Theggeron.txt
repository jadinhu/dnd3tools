The caster's arms turn into serpents that can be used as natural weapons.
The serpents provide the caster with 10-foot reach.
They have an attack bonus of +10 (plus caster's Strength modifier) and they deal 1d8 points of damage (plus her Strength modifier).
If the caster hits with a serpent, she has poisoned her foe.
The poison deals 1d6 points of Strength damage immediately and another 1d6 points of Strength damage 1 minute later.
Each instance of damage can be negated by a successful Fortitude save (DC 16).
As a full attack action, the caster can strike with both serpents at her full attack bonus.
Corruption Cost: 1d6 points of Intelligence damage.
