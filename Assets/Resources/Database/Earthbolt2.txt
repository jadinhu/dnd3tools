With a shout, you strike the ground at your feet and create a bolt of geomantic force.
This bolt travels through the earth, causing the earth, rock, or sand to fly into the air, striking creatures along its path.
A creature caught in the area takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
This spell functions only if you are standing on dirt, clay, stone, or sand.
It does not function if you are on a wooden floor or other surface.
