<b>Simbul's Spell Trigger</b>(Magic of Faerun)

Transmutation
 <b>Level:</b>  Sorcerer 9,  Wizard 9,    
<b>Components:</b>

 	
As Simbul's spell sequencer, except that the spells to be held in the matrix may be as high as 7th level, and you may create a spell sequence of spells of 4th level or less.
In addition, you may designate one spell or one spell sequence held in the matrix to come into effect under a condition you dictate when casting Simbul's spell trigger.
This function works much like a contingency spell.
The spell (or sequence of spells) to be brought into effect by the triggering condition must be of a type that affect your person, such as feather fall or levitate.
The conditions needed to bring the matrix spells into effect must be clear, although they can be general.
In all cases, Simbul's spell trigger immediately brings into effect the designated spell (or sequence of spells), which are
&quot;cast&quot; instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur.
You cannot choose to have the spell or spells not come into effect when the triggering event occurs.
Focus: A diamond with a minimum value of 1,500 gp.
