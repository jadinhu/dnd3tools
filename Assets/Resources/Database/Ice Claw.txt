<b>You finish this evocation and a great white claw appears before you, cold air wafting off its crystalline surface.</b>
	
This spell creates a massive reptilian claw made of ice. The ice claw can make one grapple attack per round. Its attack bonus and grapple modifier are equal to your caster level + your Int modifier or Cha modifier (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively) + 7 for the claw's Strength (24). In any round when the claw is grappling a target, it deals 1d8 points of cold damage.
	
The claw can attack in the round it appears. Directing it to change targets is a standard action. It always attacks from your direction and does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. 
The claw has as many hit points as you do when undamaged and has AC 20 (+10 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that do not deal damage do not affect it. The claw cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field. It suffers the full effects of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The claw has your saving throw bonuses. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it. It has immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire.
	
<b>Focus</b>: A white leather glove and a piece of clear rock crystal.
