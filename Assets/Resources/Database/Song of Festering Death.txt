The caster sings a wailing ululation, requiring a successful Perform (singing) check (DC 20).
If the Perform check succeeds and the target fails a Fortitude saving throw, the subject's flesh bubbles and festers into pestilent blobs, dealing the subject 2d6 points of damage each round.
If the subject dies, she bursts with a sickening pop as steamy gore spills onto the ground.
