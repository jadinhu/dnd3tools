You create several balls of lightning that shed light as candles and move under your control.
Your caster level is the total number of dice of damage (d6) that you can deal with this spell (maximum 15d6), divided however you see fit among the ball lightning.
For example, a 9th-level caster could create nine balls of lightning (each dealing 1d6 points of electrical damage), or three balls of lightning (two dealing 2d6 and one dealing 5d6), and so on.
You may direct any number of lightning balls to strike one target at a time.
Each affects only one target and is not destroyed when it does so.
Targets get a Reflex save against each ball that strikes them.
You must have line of sight and line of effect to direct the balls.
Directing the balls is a free action on the round the spell is cast and a standard action on any other round.
The lightning balls can move up to 100 feet per round.
A ball dissipates if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.
Material Component: A handful of copper and iron pellets.
