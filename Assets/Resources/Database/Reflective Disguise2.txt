A reflective disguise spell causes any intelligent creature viewing you to perceive you as the same species and gender as itself, provided that its size category is no more than one away from your own.
The viewer sees your clothing and equipment as they would normally appear; the spell changes only perceptions of race and gender.
Reflective disguise does not give you any knowledge of the abilities or mannerisms of the reflected form, nor does it
alter the perceived tactile (touch), audible (sound), or olfactory (smell) properties of you or your equipment.
A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.
For example, a creature that touched you and realized that the tactile sensation did not match the visual one would be entitled to such a save.
A creature with the scent ability automatically gets a Will save if you are within its scent range.
Spell resistance also applies to this effect.
