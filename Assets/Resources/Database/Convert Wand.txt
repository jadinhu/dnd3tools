This spell temporarily transforms a magic wand of any type into a healing wand with the same number of charges remaining.
At the end of the spell's duration, the wand's original effect is restored, and any charges that were depleted remain so.
The spell level of the wand determines how powerful a healing instrument the wand becomes:
For example, a 10th-level cleric can transform a wand of lightning bolt (3rd-level spell) into a wand of cure serious wounds for 10 minutes.
