The subject can breathe freely in conditions that ordinarily inhibit respiration, such as sandstorms.
While freedom of breath is in effect, the subject does not make Constitution checks to avoid the onset of suffocation unless no breathable substance is available (such as for a human underwater or buried under sand).
The spell also protects against stenches, such as those produced by a troglodyte or a stinking cloud spell.
The subject does not have to make saves or checks against nausea and similar effects from strong odors.
Freedom of breath also grants a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves and Constitution checks to resist poisonous vapors, such as those from a volcanic caldera or a cloudkill spell, for the duration of the spell.
Material Component: A sliver of mica.
