As you crook your finger, your enemy feels his vitals rupture within him.
You magically disrupt the subject's internal organs, causing it great pain.
Each round on your turn, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage and becomes nauseated for 1 round.
A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and lessens the nauseated condition to sickened.
