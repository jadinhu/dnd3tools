When you cast this spell, the arcane energies reroute local ley lines and telluric currents, precipitating the creation of a Class 1 node (you determine the type when you cast the spell).
The new node is centered on and emanates from a point on the ground you touch.
The rough boundary of the new node can cross any type of terrain or empty space, and can cross different types of materials.
You have some leeway in determining the initial shape of your node's outer boundary ï¿½ ;it doesn't have to be a perfect sphere.
The newly generated node retains its Class 1 status for one year.
Thereafter, its diameter increases at rate of 20 feet per year, until it eventually reaches a diameter equal to 20 feet per the caster level you possessed at the time of casting.
When the node's diameter reaches the low end of the range for the next higher class (see Table 5-1 on page 96), its class increases by +1.
For example, a Class 1 node becomes Class 2 when its diameter reaches 40 feet, and Class 3 when its diameter reaches 120 feet.
Nodes you create with this spell are automatically considered node locked by you.
They are otherwise just like natural nodes and subject to destruction in the same ways.
XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
Special: You must have the Node Spellcasting feat to cast this spell.
