Swirling wisps of darkness obscure your form, granting you concealment.
The 20% miss chance is active even if the attacker has darkvision.
This spell effect is suppressed in daylight or in the area of a light spell of 3rd level or higher.
See invisibility does not counter the veil of shadow's concealment effect, but a true seeing spell does.
