The subject of a resurgence spell can make a second attempt to save against an ongoing spell, spell- ike ability, or supernatural ability, such as dominate person. If the subject of resurgence is affected by more than one ongoing magical effect, the subject chooses one of them to retry the save against. If the subject succeeds on the saving throw on the second attempt, the effect ends immediately. Resurgence never restores hit points or ability score damage, but it does eliminate any conditions such as shaken, fatigued, or nauseated that were caused by a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability.
	
If a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability doesn't allow a save (such as power word stun), then resurgence won't help the subject recover.
