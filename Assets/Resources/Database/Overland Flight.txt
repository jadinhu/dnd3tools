This spell functions like a fly spell, except you can fly at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with average maneuverability.
When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks).
This means you can cover 64 miles in an eight-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).
See page 164 for more on overland movement.
