You focus your mind and let your senses probe the room, questing and seeking for any trace of a bound vestige.
You can detect an aura emanating from anyone currently bound to a vestige who is within the spell's area.
The amount of information revealed about each shared soul depends on how long you study a particular area, as follows.
1st Round: Presence or absence of vestige auras.
2nd Round: Number of vestige auras in the area and the strength of the strongest vestige present.
3rd Round: The strength and location of each vestige-bound individual.
If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
Aura Strength: The strength of a vestige aura is determined by theminimum effective binder level necessary to summon it, as given on the following table.
Each round, you can turn to detect vestige-bound individuals in a new area.
The spell can penetrate most barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
