The subject's hands sprout claws as hard as stone.
It can use these claws to burrow through earth, sand, clay, and gravel (but not solid rock), excavating with enough speed to move through the earth at a speed of 10 feet, much like a badger.
The subject can use the claws as weapons that deal 1d6 points of damage.
If its normal unarmed damage is greater than 1d6, the damage does not change.
The subject is considered armed while this spell is in effect.
Arcane Focus: A claw from a burrowing creature.
This spell supersedes the version from Races of FaerÃ»n.
