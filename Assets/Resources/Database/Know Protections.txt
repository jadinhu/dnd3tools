You learn many of the unusual defenses the target creature has.
The spell tells you the creature's damage reduction, spell resistance, and any resistances or immunity to energy attacks.
For example, if cast upon a vampire, you learn that it has damage reduction 15/+1, and cold and electricity resistance 20; you do not learn about its fast healing or turn resistance.
If cast upon a pit fiend, you learn that it has damage reduction 25/+2, spell resistance 28, is immune to fire, and has acid and cold resistance 20; it does not tell you any of its other defenses, such as fast healing or immunity to poison.
