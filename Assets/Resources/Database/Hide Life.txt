You isolate your life force in one single part of the body-typically the little finger on the left hand.
You can then remove this part and store it in some safe place.
Once the spell takes effect, you can no longer be killed by ordinary means: If damage or a spell effect would normally render you disabled, dying, or dead, you ignore the usual effects.
Instead, you are staggered (only able to take partial actions).
While this spell is in effect, if you would otherwise be disabled or dying, you do not lose hit points for taking actions or having a negative hit point total.
Healing does not automatically return you to 0 hit points but simply adjusts your current total upward.
If you would otherwise be dead, you cannot benefit from healing and simply fall down dead if the spell is ended.
If the hidden body part is ever destroyed, the spell is broken and your life force returns to your body if you would not otherwise be dead.
Material Component: A small sickle made of the purest silver, which you use to detach the body part to be stored.
XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
