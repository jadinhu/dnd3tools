With a shout, you cause your foes to erupt in afoul, acrid-smelling burst of yellow fire.
The subject ignites in a burst of sulfuric fire that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and causes the subject to be sickened for 5 rounds.
A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickening.
Material Component: A pinch of brimstone.
