You cause the target to glow with a soft, faint, rosy radiance equal to candlelight.
This glow grants the subject a sacred bonus equal to +1 per caster level (maximum +10) on saving throws against effects that work by causing pain (such as Nybor's gentle reminder), effects that would cause the target to become sickened or nauseated, and fear effects.
