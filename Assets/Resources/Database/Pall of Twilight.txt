A creeping pall of darkness covers the area like running ink, muting sound and color alike.
This spell reduces illumination in the area to shadowy; these shadows are mental as well as physical.
All creatures in the area take a -10 penalty on Listen, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.
A successful Will save negates these penalties, but not the effect of the darkness.
