Your arms and legs fuse with your body as bright silvery scales cover your skin.
You take the form of a Diminutive fish.
Use the statistics for the toad (MM 282) except for the following changes: Add the aquatic subtype, replace the land speed with a swim speed of 30 feet, remove the amphibious special quality, and replace the toad's skills with Listen +4, Spot +4, and Swim +13.
A fish adds its Dexterity modifier, not its Strength modifier, to Swim checks, and gains a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks due to its swim speed.
See the polymorph subschool description on page 91 for more details.
As its name suggests, this spell's most common use is to make a quick getaway in a watery environment, but it also allows a clever druid to overcome a flooded corridor or similar obstacle.
