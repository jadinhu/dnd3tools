A crown of divine energy appears upon the target's brow.
The holy symbol of the caster's faith is set at the front of the crown.
You create a magic crown infused with divine energy harmful to enemies of your faith.
Choose a single alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) when you cast this spell.
Once per minute, the crown's wearer gains a +2 divine bonus on damage rolls on his next melee or ranged attack if his target has the designated alignment.
The crown's wearer must decide to use this extra damage before making his attack.
If he misses, the extra damage is lost.
As an immediate action, the creature wearing a crown of smiting can discharge its magic to gain a +8 divine bonus on damage on a single attack.
The spell ends after the wearer uses the crown in this manner.
The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm.
If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.
Focus: A silver hoop 6 inches in diameter costing 25 gp.
