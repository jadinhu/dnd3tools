You cup your hands as if to catch the light and then bend them outward, causing the air in front of the recipient's eyes to take on a shimmery, reflective quality.
This spell creates a mirrorlike area around the recipient's eyes.
This effect moves with the recipient and does not affect his vision.
If the recipient is subjected to a gaze attack while the spell lasts, there is a 50% chance that he does not need to attempt a saving throw against the attack (just as if the recipient had averted his eyes).
The foe with the gaze attack does not have concealment from the recipient (see Gaze Attacks, <span class="caps">DMG</span> 294).
The recipient gets no additional protection from averting his eyes while the spell lasts, though he can shut his eyes and entirely avoid the gaze.
