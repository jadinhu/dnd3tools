You and your mount utter a fierce call as one.
The beating of its hooves grows almost deafening, and the world around you begins to shimmer.
If you cast this spell while mounted on your special mount or mount-sized fiendish companion, you tap into the energies normally released only when you summon or dismiss that creature, creating a short-range teleportation effect.
Between a single pair of steps, you and your mount can teleport directly forward once, moving up to 5 feet per two caster levels.
Many paladins use this spell to attack over rough terrain that would normally prevent a charge.
Because this spell can be cast while your mount is moving, the creature can move part of its speed both before and after the spell takes effect.
If you cast this spell in conjunction with master cavalier (page 124) and war-mount (page 129), the three spells have a synergistic effect.
See the master cavalier spell description for details.
