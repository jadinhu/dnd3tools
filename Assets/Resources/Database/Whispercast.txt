The next spell you cast can be cast as a purely mental action, provided that it is of 5th level or lower and that you can whisper. It requires no somatic or material components, unless the spell normally requires a focus or an expensive material component (any component worth more than 1 gp). If the spell does require a focus or an expensive component, you can still whispercast it as long as you have the focus or expensive component on your person ï¿½ ;the magic of whispercast causes the focus to be used or the expensive component to be consumed normally, without you having to handle or manipulate it.
	
If you do not cast a second spell while whispercast is in effect, you gain no benefit from casting whispercast.
	
Casting this spell is a swift action. It does not require a move action or standard action, but you can take only one swift, immediate, or quickened action per turn. 
	
Tsochari spellcasters use this spell to permit spellcasting while they inhabit other creatures. It is also useful for grappled spellcasters.
