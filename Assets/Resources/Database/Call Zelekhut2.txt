<b>You make the necessary conjurations and the powers of Mechanus respond. The Zelekhut fades into view, its centaur form accompanied by the sound of rattling silver chains. &quot;Who seeks to escape justice?&quot; it asks with the solemn tones of a judge's gavel.</b>
	
By casting this spell, you receive the aid of a zelekhut inevi-table (<b>MM</b> 160). If you know an individual zelekhut's name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, 
anyway).
	
You can ask the zelekhut to perform one duty for you. The task must take no more than 1 hour to complete. The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task.
