You can sacrifice life force to increase the damage you deal.
When you cast the spell, you can sacrifice up to 10 of your hit points.
For every 2 hp you sacrifice, on your next successful attack you deal +1d6 damage, to a maximum of +5d6 on that attack.
Your ability to deal this extra damage ends when you successfully attack or when the spell duration ends.
Sacrificed hit points count as normal lethal damage, even if you have the regeneration ability.
