You coat the target's lungs with dust and sand.
The target can cough up the sand by taking a full-round action and making a Fortitude save.
If it chooses not to do so, it must make Constitution checks to avoid suffocation (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Material Component: A tiny stuffed animal filled with sand.
