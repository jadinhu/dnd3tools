When you cast this spell, you spit forth a cone of icy crystals, engulfing creatures within a cone area.
Affected creatures are covered with a thin layer of ice, taking 1d6 points of subdual damage per two caster levels (maximum of 10d6).
In addition, creatures suffer from a temporary frostbite condition, making them fatigued.
Fatigued creatures cannot run or charge and suffer a -2 effective penalty to Strength and Dexterity.
The frostbite effect lasts 3 rounds.
A successful Fortitude save negates both the subdual damage and the frostbite effect.
Material Component: A mouthful of water.
