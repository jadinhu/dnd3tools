This spell imbues one of your weapons with great killing power against a single favored enemy type.
Against creatures of that type, the weapon acts as a +5 magic weapon and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.
Furthermore, while you wield the weapon, you gain a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against effects created by creatures of that type.
The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand for any reason.
You cannot have more than one foebane weapon active at a time.
If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell.
This spell is not cumulative with any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.
This spell does not work on artifacts.
