A Stone Dragon adept is an implacable foe. Your attacks smash through armor and turn bone into dust. By focusing your strength into a single, devastating attack, you smash an opponent to the core. His very health and endurance are left wrecked by your attack. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. If your attack hits, the target takes normal damage as well as 2 points of Constitution damage.
