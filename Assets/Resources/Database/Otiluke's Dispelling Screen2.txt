You create an opaque, immobile, shimmering screen of violet energy Any creature or unattended object passing through the screen is affected by a targeted dispel magic cast at your caster level (see page 196 of the Player's Handbook).
You make a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature.
A dispel check is 1d20 +1 per caster level (maximum +10) against a DC of 11+the spell's caster level.
The screen has no effect on any items a creature carries.
If an unattended magic item passes through the screen, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level.
If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds.
Spell effects that are not operating on objects or creatures cannot pass through the screen.
A disintegrate or successful dispel magic spell removes Otiluke's dispelling screen, while an antimagic field suppresses it.
Material Component: A sheet of fine lead crystal.
