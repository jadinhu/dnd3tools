This spell functions like Bigby's interposing hand, except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or crush one opponent that you select.
The crushing hand can grapple an opponent like Bigby's grasping hand does.
Its grapple bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +12 for the hand's Strength score (35), +4 for being Large.
The hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage (lethal, not nonlethal) on each successful grapple check against an opponent.
The crushing hand can also interpose itself as Bigby's interposing hand does, or it can bull rush an opponent as Bigby's forceful hand does, but at a +18 bonus.
Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.
Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities ï¿½ ;St.
Cuthbert's crushing hand, for example.
Arcane Material Component: The shell of an egg.
Arcane Focus: A glove of snakeskin.
