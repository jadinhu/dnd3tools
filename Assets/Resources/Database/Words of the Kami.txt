To utter the holy words of the kami is to bring forth magic of awesome power.
Creatures with the Shadowlands subtype or with a Taint score suffer the following ill effects:
The effects are cumulative.
Deafened: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds.
A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, automatically fails Listen checks, suffers a -4 penalty on initiative, and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal (V) component that it tries to cast.
Blinded: The creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds.
In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a <del>4 penalty on most Strength</del> and Dexterity-based skill checks.
Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes, unable to move or act in any way.
Killed: Living creatures die.
Undead creatures are destroyed.
Creatures free of Taint and without the Shadowlands subtype, including the spellcaster, are deafened for 1d4 rounds, regardless of their Hit Dice.
