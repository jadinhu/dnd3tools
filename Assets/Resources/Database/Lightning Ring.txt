This spell conjures a crackling ring of bright white lightning that hovers around you at chest height.
The ring moves with you and does not interfere with your spellcasting or attacks, or with others attacking you.
As long as the lightning ring is in effect, you gain resistance to electricity 20.
Each round on your action, the lightning ring emits two lightning bolts, exactly as the lightning bolt spell (caster level 5th), in any directions you choose.
Each bolt may be aimed separately.
A creature struck by one of these bolts may make a Reflex save for half damage.
The DC for this save is calculated for an 8th-level spell, even though the bolts mimic a 3rd-level spell.
Alternately, you may choose to release the lightning ring's power all at once.
When you complete the casting of the spell, you unleash eight lightning bolts that travel in all directions.
(See the diagram for missing with thrown weapons on page 158 of the Player's Handbook for an illustration of the directions these bolts travel).
This use of the lightning ring spell has an instantaneous duration.
You must choose whether to store the power of the lightning ring or release it all at once when you cast it.
Material Components: A small glass ring and a bit of fur from any animal.
