You tear off a piece of a creature's life force, corrupt it with negative energy and the power of undeath, then bind it back to the same creature's body.
This process initiates a blasphemous transformation when the creature dies.
The subject of this spell loses 2 points of Constitution upon casting.
When it dies, the corrupted life force initiates a slow change in its body, causing it to animate as a crypt spawn at the next sunset (see Chapter 6 in Monstrous Compendium:
Monsters of FaerÃ»n).
If the creature's remains are destroyed, the undeath after death spell cannot bring it back as an undead.
Even if the spell is dispelled before the subject dies, it still does not regain its lost Constitution points.
Material Components: A piece of obsidian shaped like a heart, which is placed on the subject's chest, and a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD the subject creature possesses at the time the spell is cast.
This gem must be placed in the subject's mouth.
