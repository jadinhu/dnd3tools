A dull gray ray projects from your hand.

The target's natural armor bonus is reduced by 4 points, +1 point per two caster levels above 3rd (maximum reduction 10 points at 15th level).
This spell can't reduce a creature's natural armor bonus to less than 0, nor does it have any effect on an enhancement bonus to natural armor (such as that granted by the barkskin spell).
