You grant a creature the ability to maneuver easily while aboard ship, even during inclement weather.
Any creature affected by a sea legs spell automatically succeeds on Balance checks (DC 20 or lower) made due to sloped surfaces and slightly slippery conditions.
Furthermore, the creature can move at its normal speed while balancing on a ship's deck, rather than half speed.
See the Balance skill description in the Player's Handbook for more information.
