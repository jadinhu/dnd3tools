One of your hands bursts into an aura of brilliant emerald flame, shedding light equal to that of a torch.
You take no damage or penalties from the flames, but on a melee touch attack, an emerald flame fist deals 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
The creature you touch must then succeed on a Fortitude save or be engulfed by the fiercely hot aura of flame.
Each round on your turn, a creature engulfed in the flaming aura takes 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20) until the spell ends (Fortitude save each round for half).
You can use your flaming touch attack repeatedly until one of your targets is engulfed, at which point the flame leaves your hand.
You can use this spell to attack an object.
Nonmagical, unattended objects are automatically engulfed in green flame and take 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level each round.
