This spell functions like <b>true domination</b> (page 224), except that the subject can be any creature and is permanently dominated if it fails its initial Will save. A subject ordered to take an action against its nature receives a saving throw with a -4 penalty to resist taking that particular action. If the save succeeds, the subject still remains your thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty.
