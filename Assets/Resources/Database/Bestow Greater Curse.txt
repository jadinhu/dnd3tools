The caster places a curse on the creature touched, choosing one of the following three effects:			One ability score is reduced to 1, or two ability scores take -6 penalties (to a minimum score of 1).		-8 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.		Each turn, the subject has a 25% chance to act normally; otherwise, he takes no action.	
A player may invent a new curse, but it should be no more powerful than those listed above, and the Dungeon Master (DM) has final say on the curse's effect.
A greater curse cannot be dispelled, nor can it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, or remove curse spell.
A miracle or wish spell removes the greater curse, and any particular greater curse can be removed if the subject performs some deed that the caster designates.
The deed must be something that the subject can accomplish within one year (assuming he undertakes it immediately).
For example, the deed might be &quot;Slay the dragon under Castle Bluecraft&quot;, or &quot;Climb the tallest mountain in the world&quot;.
The cursed victim can have help accomplishing the task, and in some cases another character can lift the curse (see the Curses section of Chapter 2 for guidelines).
