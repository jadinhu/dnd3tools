You summon an avalanche of snow out of a rift in midair, burying your foes and sending them to a frosty death.
The obedient avalanche affects creatures differently, depending on where they are in relation to the avalanche.
Within 20 Feet of the Center Point: Creatures take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8) and an additional 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels.
Creatures who fail their saves are also buried (as described in Avalanches, page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
All squares within 20 feet of the center point are covered in heavy snow (see page 94 of the Dungeon Master's Guide),
which persists as long as ordinary snow would.
Between 20 Feet and 40 Feet of the Center Point: Creatures take half as much damage from the impact of the avalanche as the creatures nearer the center point took (Reflex save negates).
Creatures who fail their saves must also resist the force of the snow moving past them as if they were being bull rushed.
The snow has a +13 bonus (+5 for effective Strength of 20 and +8 for effectively being Huge) on the bull rush check, and it pushes characters away from the center point of the spell.
All squares in the 20-foot to 40-foot ring are covered in light snow, which persists as long as ordinary snow would.
Terrain and Structures: The avalanche uproots small trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of light rubble (as described on page 91 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) even after the snow melts.
Structures struck by an obedient avalanche take 1d610 points of damage.
The obedient avalanche extinguishes all flames, whether normal or magical, it touches.
