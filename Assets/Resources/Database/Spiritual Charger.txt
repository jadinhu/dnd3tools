A lance-wielding rider of pure force, bearing the symbol of your deity, springs into being and immediately makes one attack against a target you designate within range.
The rider's attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus plus your Wisdom modifier.
If the rider appears in a location at least 10 feet distant from its target, the spiritual charger gains an additional +2 bonus on the attack roll because it is able to make a charge before attacking.
A spiritual charger deals 2d8 points of force damage, +1 point per three caster levels (up to a maximum of 2d8+5 at 15th level).
A spiritual charger threatens a critical hit on a natural 20 and deals triple damage on a successful critical hit.
