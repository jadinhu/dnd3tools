The subject of this powerful spell is unable to die from hit point damage.
While under the protection of this spell, the normal limit of -9 hit points before a character dies is extended without limit.
A condition or spell that destroys enough of the subject's body to prohibit raise dead (such as a disintegrate effect) still kills the creature, as does death brought about by ability score damage or drain, level drain, or a death effect.
The spell does not prevent the subject from entering the dying state by dropping to -1 hit points.
It merely prevents death as a result of hit point loss.
If the subject has fewer than -9 hit points when the spell's duration expires, he or she dies instantly.
