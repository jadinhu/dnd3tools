You delve into your subject's mind and call forth a clinging, choking horror that drapes itself over him like a vile net.
You fashion a nightmare creature from the subject's mind.
Only the subject can sense the assailant, which exists only in the subject's mind.
When you cast the spell, the subject gets an immediate Will save to recognize the attacker as unreal, which ends the spell.
If that save fails, the subject is treated as if it were grappling the phantasmal strangles.
Each round on your turn, a phantasmal strangler deals 2d6 points of damage to the subject.
If the subject is reduced to -1 or fewer hit points, the spell ends.
Each round on the subject's turn, it can attempt any of the actions normally allowed to a grappling character.
Treat a phantasmal strangler's grapple modifier as equal to that of the subject (including modifiers for Strength, size, and all other factors).
A phantasmal strangler can't be damaged, nor can it be pinned.
If the subject escapes from the phantasmal strangler's grasp, the spell ends.
