Particularly effective against cavalry, this spell causes all affected animals to become panicked. If a panicked animal carries a rider, the rider must succeed on a DC 25 Ride check to prevent the animal from trying to flee the battlefield. If the animal successfully saves, it is instead shaken for the duration of the spell.
