The creatures you touch gain the benefits of 8 hours of restful sleep.
If a subject was fatigued, the fatigue and its penalties are removed.
If a subject was exhausted, the exhaustion becomes fatigue, but the subject only needs to rest for 1 more hour to eliminate the fatigue.
If a subject was already well rested, it does not need to rest or sleep during the next 24 hours.
Arcane spellcasters must still rest their minds for 8 hours in order to prepare or ready their spells.
