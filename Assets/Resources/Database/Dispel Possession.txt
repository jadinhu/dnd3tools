You force a being that is possessing a creature out of its host body.
The possessor acts as if it had left its host voluntarily (a ghost appears next to the host, a person using magic jar returns to its receptacle if in range or dies if it is not, and so on).
Alternatively, this spell may be used as a form of dispel magic to dispel a charm, dominate, or similar effect on a target.
Material Component: powered silver worth 1 gp.
