You invoke healing energy over a group of creatures, granting each the fast healing ability for the duration of the spell.
This healing applies only to damage sustained during the spells duration, not to that from previous injuries.
Each subject heals 1 hit point per round of such damage until the spell ends and is automatically stabilized if he or she begins dying from hit point loss during that time.
Regenerate ring does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow or attach lost body parts.
The effects of multiple regenerate spells do not stack; only the highest-level effect applies.
Applying a second regenerate spell of equal level extends the first spell's duration by the full duration of the second spell.
