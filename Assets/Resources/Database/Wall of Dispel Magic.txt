<b>You cast the spell and a translucent wall springs up, a shimmering field of faded colors that swirls and merges with itself like the surface of a soap bubble.</b>
	
This spell creates a transparent, permeable barrier. Anyone passing through it becomes the target of a <b>dispel magic</b> effect (PH 223) at your caster level. A summoned creature targeted in this way can be dispelled by the effect.
	
A wall of dispel magic cannot be seen or felt by ordinary means, or even with a see invisibility spell. Detect magic indicates the presence of the effect, and true seeing reveals its presence.
