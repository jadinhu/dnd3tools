You create a distracting and discordant chant.
Affected creatures that attempt spellcasting or other activities that require concentration must make Concentration checks (DC 18 + Int or Cha modifier, for wizards or sorcerers respectively) to succeed.
Activities that already require Concentration checks, such as casting defensively, have their DC increased by the save DC of this spell -10.
For example, this spell cast by a wizard with 14 Intelligence would have a DC of 14; a cleric trying to cast spiritual weapon within the area would have to succeed on a Concentration check against DC 21 (15 + 2 for spiritual weapon spell level + 14 for dissonant chant save DC &#8211; 10 = 21).
Creatures within the area gain a bonus on saving throws against language-dependent effects equal to this spell's DC -10.
While this spell does not allow a saving throw, the save DC for the spell is calculated normally (10 + spell level + Int or Cha modifier) to determine the modifier to the Concentration checks of those within the spell's area.
