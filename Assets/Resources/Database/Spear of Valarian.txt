The spear of Valarian spell transforms one nonmagical weapon into a shimmering silver spear.
You must be carrying the weapon and have it drawn for the spell to work.
The shimmering spear functions as a +1 silvered spear.
Against magical beasts, the weapon becomes a +3 silvered spear that deals +2d6 points of bonus damage (as the bane special property).
If the spear of Valarian is sundered, the original weapon breaks as the spell suddenly ends.
If the wielder relinquishes the spear, willingly or not, it immediately reverts to its previous state and the spell ends.
