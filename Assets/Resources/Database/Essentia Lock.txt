When you cast essentia lock, you freeze the subject's current allocation of essentia in place.
The target is unable to shift essentia to or from any soulmelds, feats, or other essentia receptacles he might possess, and must maintain his current allocation of essentia for the duration of the spell.
Creatures without essentia are unaffected by this spell.
Arcane Focus: A tiny padlock made of silver (10 gp).
