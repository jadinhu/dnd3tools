A swarm of dire rats viciously attacks all other creatures within a 20-foot spread, inflicting damage and spreading filth fever (see page 74 of the <span class="caps">DUNGEON</span> MASTER'S Guide).
A creature in the swarm that takes no action other than fighting off the rats takes 1d4 points of damage on its turn and makes a Fortitude saving throw against DC 15 + your Intelligence bonus to avoid contracting filth fever.
A creature in the swarm who takes any other action, including leaving the swarm, takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level, and must save at a -4 penalty to avoid contracting the disease.
Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the swarm is impossible.
The rats' attacks are nonmagical, so being incorporeal, damage reduction, and other defenses can protect a creature from damage.
The disease effect is magical and spread by touch.
Any corporeal creature in the swarm that is subject to disease may contract it.
The swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and damaging area effects can force it to disperse.
The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 8 points of damage per caster level from these attacks.
A stinking cloud spell and similar area or effect spells disperse a swarm immediately.
As a move-equivalent action, you can direct the swarm to move up to 40 feet per round.
