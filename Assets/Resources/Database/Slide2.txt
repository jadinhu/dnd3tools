<b>When you speak the word that activates the spell, the soles of your ally's feet glow yellow as he is lifted slightly off the ground. He slips five feet across the ground, into position to flank his opponent.</b>
	
You slide the subject creature along the ground a distance of 5 feet in any direction. (If the creature is flying or otherwise not on the ground, it moves parallel to the ground.) You can't slide the subject into a space that is occupied by an ally, an enemy, or a solid object; if you attempt to do so, the spell automatically ends. You cannot slide the subject up or down, but you can slide it over the edge of a cliff or other drop-off if you desire.
	
This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
