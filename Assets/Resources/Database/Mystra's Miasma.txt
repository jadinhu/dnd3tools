This potent spell conjures forth a thick, billowing cloud of mist that functions as a solid fog spell.
In addition, the mist creates a &quot;sinkhole&quot; in the Weave, greatly reducing the power of spellcasters in that spot.
Each character within the area of Mystra's miasma takes a -4 penalty on caster level checks when attempting to cast spells.
A successful Will save made upon first entering the miasma negates this effect.
Creatures who access the Shadow Weave to cast their spells are immune to the caster level check penalty unless you also call upon the Shadow Weave.
In that case, the spell is called Shar's miasma and Weave users are immune to the caster level check penalty.
Material Component: A small piece of quilted cloth, which must be soaked in water while the spell is cast.
