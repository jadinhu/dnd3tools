This spell transforms a single weapon or projectile you are holding into a silvered weapon.
The weapon may be magical, masterwork, or nonmagical, but it must be in hand when the spell is cast.
You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see silvered claws).
The spell cannot be cast on more than one weapon or on multiple projectiles.
If the weapon targeted by the spell is made of another special material (cold iron or adamantine, for example), it
loses the benefits of its original special material for the spell's duration.
Silvered weapon can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
