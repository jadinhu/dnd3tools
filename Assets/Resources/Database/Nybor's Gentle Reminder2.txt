This spell has long been popular with slave overseers and those wishing to make their servants work a little faster.
The Red Wizards now employ it primarily as a combat spell.
When the spell is cast, the subject suffers a sharp, agonizing pain that leaves it dazed for 1 round.
In each subsequent round for the duration of the spell, the subject takes a -2 penalty on attacks, saving throws, and checks.
Furthermore, a spellcaster targeted by Nybor's gentle reminder is distracted by the pain and must make a successful Concentration check to cast spells while under its effect (see the Concentration skill description, page 69 of the Player's Handbook).
Focus: A stick at least 1 foot long.
