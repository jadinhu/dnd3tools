You cup your hand and the object you desire appears in your palm.
You conjure the material component or components for a single spell that you can cast.
No component you summon can be worth more than a single gold piece, and it can't be a magic item.
Summoned components disappear when the spell duration expires, if they were not consumed in casting the spell.
