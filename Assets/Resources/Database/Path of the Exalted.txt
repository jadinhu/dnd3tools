Path of the exalted allows the caster to consult her deity (or an agent of her deity) to help make a difficult decision.
This decision is usually more complex than a simple morality question.
It may involve strategizing, choosing a particular lead to follow in an investigation, deciding who to help, or other difficult choices.
The deity or agent simply helps the character examine a known situation from a number of different angles and makes a recommendation about the correct path to take.
This spell does not reveal unknown factors, but merely helps the caster analyze known elements.
The spell ends when the deity or agent has provided sufficient guidance for the caster to arrive at a decision.
If the caster is out of favor with her deity, this spell may not work until the caster atones.
Abstinence Component: The caster must abstain from casting Divination spells for 24 hours prior to the casting of this spell.
