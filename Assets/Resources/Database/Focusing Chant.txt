You can use focusing chant to block out distractions and hone your attention.
You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for the duration of the spell.
You need not concentrate on focusing chant, but you must continue to mutter the syllables of the chant to maintain the spell.
Therefore, you cannot speak, use bardic music effects, or cast spells with verbal components while a focusing chant spell is in effect.
Dismissing focusing chant is an immediate action.
