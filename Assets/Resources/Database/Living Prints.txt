You perceive tracks as if they had just been made.
You must notice the prints normally with a successful Search or Wilderness Lore check, but this spell eliminates any penalties to your tracking due to the passage of time or any rainfall since the making of the trail.
This spell has no effect on tracks more than thirty days old.
