A touch from your hand can cause the target's body to weaken and wither.
With a successful melee touch attack, you deal 1 point of temporary Strength damage and 1 point of temporary Constitution damage per two caster levels to the target.
If you score a critical hit, the damage from the hit is actually permanent ability drain.
