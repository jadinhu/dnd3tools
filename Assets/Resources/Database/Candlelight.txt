You cause an object to glow like a candle, shedding light in a 5-foot radius from the point you touch.
The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object if desired.
The light produced by this cantrip is not strong enough to counter or dispel any magical darkness.
Invented by the elves for use in nighttime ceremonies, candlelight has made its way into common usage.
It is particularly useful to novices and apprentices who need to spend long hours in study.
Arcane Material Component: A tiny candle.
