You shield one creature in a nimbus of holy energy.
The creature gains a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class.
In addition, while protected by this spell, the creature does not lose its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class when flat-footed.
For the duration of the spell, you gain awareness of the creature's health as with the status spell, and you need not be able to touch the affected creature to heal it with your lay on hands ability.
Use of the lay on hands ability still requires a standard action, but it can be done at any range.
