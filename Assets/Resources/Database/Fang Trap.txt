While casting this spell, you physically trace the area or handle the object to be trapped.
A fang trap functions like a glyph of warding, except that it can't be made to activate on the basis of faith or alignment, and you can't be caught in your own fang trap.
A fang trap is usually cast on a specific spot, such as a doorway or an area of floor.
It can be set to distinguish between humans and Scaled Ones, or between beings wearing particular items and those who are not.
The trigger can't be a symbol, but it may be one or more specific items (for example, &quot;six metal rings on digits, no more and no less&quot;).
When a fang trap discharges, the subject is held immobile for 1 round.
A successful Fortitude saving throw frees the subject after that period without further effect.
A failed save means the subject takes 1d4 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage per caster level from the bite of a pair of unseen jaws.
Material Component: A fang from any snake.
