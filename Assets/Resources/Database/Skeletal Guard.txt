You create a number of loyal skeletons from finger bones.
All skeletons are Medium-size with the normal Monster Manual statistics for their kind, except their effective Hit Dice as far as turning is concerned is equal to your class level.
These skeletons count toward the number of Hit Dice of undead you can have in your control.
You can create one skeleton per caster level.
Unlike the animate dead spell, these skeletons try to remain within 60 feet of you.
If you exceed this range, they become inert until you return.
Material Components:One finger bone and one onyx gem worth 50 gp per skeleton to be created.
If the finger bones come from a Medium-size creature, the skeleton that forms from that finger bone is that type of creature.
