You tap the ancient knowledge of fate and fortune, giving you a greater ability to focus on a particularly difficult academic problem. Before making a Knowledge check, you can decide to discharge this spell as an immediate action to give yourself a +5 insight bonus on the check. If you do not have any ranks in the Knowledge skill, it is still treated as an untrained check.
	
<b>Special:</b> A character with any Mark of Finding dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Tharashk), treats any Knowledge check made in conjunction with this spell as a trained check, even if he doesn't have any ranks in the skill.
