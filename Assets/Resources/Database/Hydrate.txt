This spell allows you to create moisture within the body of a living creature, healing damage from dehydration.
Hydrate heals 2d8 points +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) of dessication damage, removes all nonlethal damage from dehydration, and clears up any lingering effects of the dehydrated condition.
When cast on a creature of the fire subtype, hydrate deals damage instead of healing.
Such a creature can apply spell resistance and attempt a Will save to take half damage.
