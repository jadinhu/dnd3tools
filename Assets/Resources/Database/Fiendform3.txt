This spell functions like polymorph, except as indicated.
You may take the form of any fiendish creature, demon, or devil that can be summoned by a summon monster I, II, <span class="caps">III</span>,
or IV spell.
You can assume only one form with each use of the spell, but you gain all the assumed form's extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abilities.
Your type changes to outsider, and spells and effects that harm or ward evil outsiders affect you.
Any effect that would banish you to your home plane ends this spell and leaves you staggered for 1 round per caster level but does not send you to another plane.
Material Component: A bone from any fiendish creature, half-fiendish creature, demon, or devil.
