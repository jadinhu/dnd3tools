This spell was created by the lich Larloch to power himself at the expense of his own undead minions.
The target undead creatures must succeed at Fortitude saving throws or be destroyed, just as if hit by a disruption weapon.
Creatures that are not undead, and undead with Hit Dice greater than the caster's caster level, are unaffected by this spell.
If an undead creature is destroyed by this spell, a portion of the negative energy that gave it unlife flows back to the caster.
This negative energy deals (if the caster is living) or cures (if the caster is undead) 5 hit points of damage per hit die of the destroyed undead.
Focus: A disruption weapon of any kind.
