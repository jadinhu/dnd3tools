In a blinding shower of light, you call an enormous, painfully bright rainbow from the heavens.
This spell produces a column of colors resembling the end of a rainbow.
Every creature in the area is affected as though by the prismatic spray spell (PH 264): blinded for 2d4 rounds if 8 HD or fewer, and you roll 1d8 on the prismatic spray table to see what color affects which target.
