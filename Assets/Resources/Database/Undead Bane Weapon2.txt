You give a weapon the undead bane special ability in addition to any other properties it has.
Against undead, your weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) is 2 higher than normal and it deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against undead.
The spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon that already has the undead bane special ability.
At caster level 9th (paladin level 18th) and above, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus if it is not already a magic weapon.
Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets.
The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together, such as in the same quiver.
Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their transmutation when fired.
The weapon is considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Any weapon affected by this spell glows with a serene gray radiance that sheds as much light as a candle.
