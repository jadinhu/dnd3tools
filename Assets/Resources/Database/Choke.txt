A pair of invisible hands made of pure force spring into existence around the target's throat and begin to strangle it.
Only aberrations, animals, beasts, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, outsiders, and shapechangers can be affected.
Creatures without necks, such as beholders, cannot be affected.
The hands cannot be attacked or damaged.
The target takes 1d4 points of damage per round but can make a Reflex save each round for half damage.
All attack rolls and checks the target makes while being choked suffer a -2 circumstance penalty; if the check involves speaking, the circumstance penalty is -4.
Spellcasting is possible, but the target must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10+ spell level +1/2 the last damage dealt) or lose the spell.
The -2 circumstance penalty also applies to the check, or &#8211; 4 if the spell has a verbal component.
