With a touch of your hand, you boost the subject's life energy, granting him or her the fast healing ability for the duration of the spell.
The subject heals 1 hit point per round of such damage until the spell ends and is automatically stabilized if he or she begins dying from hit point loss during that time.
Lesser vigor does not restore hit points lost fromstarvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow or attach lost body parts.
The effects of multiple vigor spells do not stack; only the highest-level effect applies.
Applying a second vigor spell of equal level extends the first spell's duration by the full duration of the second spell.
