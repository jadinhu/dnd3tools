A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.
	
Light spells counter and dispel darkness spells of an equal or lower level.
	
Material Component: You sprinkle ruby dust (worth 50 gp) on the item that is to carry the flame.
