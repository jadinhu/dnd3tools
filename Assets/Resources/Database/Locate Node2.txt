You sense the direction of any earth node within range.
You can choose to locate either the nearest node or a specific node you have visited before.
(In the latter case, the range is 2 miles/level and the area is a circle, centered on you, with a radius of 2 miles/level).
The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead, and it cannot detect nodes protected by a node lock spell.
