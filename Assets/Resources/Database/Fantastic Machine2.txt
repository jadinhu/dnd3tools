<b>Your spell generates an illusory, many-armed noisy, massive mechanical construct of impressive appearance.</b>
	
This spell creates a bizarre, but useful,, machine that you can command to perform any simple, physical task that can be described in twenty-five words or less. You can order the machine to perform the same task over and over, but you can't change the task. You must specify the task when yo cast the spell. The machine always acts on your turn in the initiative order. (It can act during the turn you cast the spell.)
	
The machine functions as a Large animated object (<b>MM</b> 13). It trundles over the ground at a speed of 40 feet. It can swim or fly at a speed of 10 feet (clumsy). It has 22 hit points, AC 14 (-1 size, +5 natural), and hardness 10. Its saving throw modifiers are Fortitude +1, Reflex +1, Will -4.
	
The machine has a Strength of 16. A light load for the machine is up to 172 pounds; a medium load is 173-346 pounds; and a heavy load is 347-520 pounds. The machine can fly or swim only when lightly loaded. The machine can lift a weight of up to 1,040 pounds to a height of 15 feet. It can push or drag 2,600 pounds. It can excavate 7,000 pounds of loose rock each minute (which is sufficient to clear a 5-by-5 foot space in 3 rounds). It can excavate sand or loose soil at twice that rate.
	
The machine has an attack bonus of +5 and can make one slam attack each round that deals 1d8 +4 points of damage. It deals triple slam damage (3d8+12) against stone or metal. The machine can hurl Small rocks (if any are at hand) with an attack bonus of +3. Its range increment is 150 feet, and it can throw a rock up to 10 range increments. A thrown rock deals 2d6+4 points of damage.
