The caster plays a catchy, silly, little tune that sticks in the mind of any subject who fails a Will save.
The endlessly recycling melody makes it very difficult for the subject to cast spells, disarm traps, or perform any other action that requires mental focus.
Thus, the subject incurs a -4 circumstance penalty on all skill checks based on Intelligence and must make a Concentration check (DC = insidious rhythms save DC + level of the spell being attempted) for each spellcasting attempt.
Focus: The caster's instrument.
