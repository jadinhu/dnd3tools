This spell thins the oxygen in the area, causing creatures caught therein to suffer the effects of extreme altitude sickness.
Subjects failing their saves take 1 point of damage to all ability scores because of altitude sickness (see page 90 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).
Characters acclimated to high altitude receive a +4 competence bonus on their saving throws.
Creatures that do not breathe are immune to the effects of the spell.
