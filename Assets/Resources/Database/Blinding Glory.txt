A brilliant radiance spreads from you, brightly illuminating the area.
The light is similar to that created by the daylight spell, but no magical darkness counters or dispels it.
Furthermore, evil-aligned creatures are blinded within this light.
Blinding glory brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa), including an utterdark spell, is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.
Arcane Material Component: A polished rod of pure silver.
