Prior to casting flesh armor, the caster flays the skin from a creature of his size and lays it upon his own flesh, wearing it like clothing or armor.
Once the caster casts flesh armor, his skin develops resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes.
The caster gains damage reduction 10/+1.
Once the spell has prevented a total of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), it is discharged, and the skin slowly rots, shedding in patches like the skin of a molting snake.
Material Component: A bit of flesh torn from the caster's body during the casting (dealing 1 point of damage).
Focus: The entire freshly harvested skin of another creature of the caster's size.
