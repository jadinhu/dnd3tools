You place a curse on the subject.
Mystra's symbol appears drawn in silver on each palm (or on the chest and forehead of beings lacking palms) as a glowing brand equal that sheds light as a candle.
A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or wizard, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw.
Any time the target casts a spell, he gains a number of negative levels equal to the level of the spell being cast.
(The spell he just cast functions normally at the caster level he possessed before he received the negative levels for casting that spell).
This effect is cumulative and lasts as long as the crowning touch lasts.
There is no saving throw to avoid gaining the negative levels, but 24 hours after gaining each negative level, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = crowning touch's spell save) for each negative level.
If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed.
With each spell use, streaks of silver appear in the hair of the target, until the transgressor's hair is all silver (which happens when the character's level reaches 1st).
The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a wish spell or a successful break enchantment spell (caster level check DC 15 + caster level of the crowning touch).
After the curse is lifted, all the effects (except permanent level loss) go away.
This spell was developed for use only against beings who misuse the sort of magic Mystra has dominion over.
The Lady of Mysteries does not look kindly on mages who hurl deadly magic at every spellcaster who insults them.
Mystra has been known to shorten the effects on the truly repentant and the undeserving, if they pray to her for forgiveness and obtain an atonement spell.
Focus: A prism worth at least 1,000 gp.
XP Cost: 1,000 XP (reduced to 500 XP if cast by a character with Mystra's special blessing, such as one of the Chosen of Mystra or the Magister).
