Upon the casting of this spell, the target's flesh transforms, assuming a dull metallic hue.
Its eyes erupt with unholy flame, and when it opens its mouth, you see the fires of Hell roiling within.
A creature affected by investiture of the hellfire engine gains all the benefits described under the iron body spell (PH 245), except that its flesh transforms into living cold iron.
Its unarmed natural attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
In addition, the subject can breathe a 30-foot cone of hellfire that deals 8d10 points damage.
This damage is not fire damage, and is not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy (fire), fire shield (chill shield),
and similar magic.
All creatures in the area are entitled to a Reflex save against the spell's DC for half damage.
The subject must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of this breath weapon.
The subject also gains resistance to fire 20.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the chain devil).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.
Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.
