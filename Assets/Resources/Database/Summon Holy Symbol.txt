You whisper a prayer to your deity, and his symbol appears in your hand.
You conjure a small holy symbol, which you can then use to turn undead, or as a divine focus for spells, or for any other purpose that you would normally use one.
The conjured holy symbol is made of wood and is neither magical nor particularly valuable.
