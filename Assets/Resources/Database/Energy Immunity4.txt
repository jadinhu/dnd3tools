This abjuration grants a creature complete protection against damage from whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.
Energy immunity absorbs only damage.
The recipient could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage results fromthe lack of oxygen), being deafened by a sonic attack, or becoming encased in ice.
Note: Energy immunity overlaps (and does not stack with) endure elements, resist elements, and protection from elements.
If a character is warded with energy immunity and one or more of the other spells, the energy immunity spell makes the others irrelevant.
