You animate a pile of rocks, branches, limbs, and other debris into the crude shape of a skeletal creature of Medium size that immediately attacks whatever foe you designate.
You can change the animated creature's chosen target as a move action.
The creature's combat statistics are those of a 2 HD humanoid skeleton, except that it also has a wight's energy drain supernatural ability (see the Skeleton and Wight entries in the Monster Manual for details).
