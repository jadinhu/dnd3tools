This spell creates a tornado that wreaks destruction as you direct, flinging your foes into the air and destroying nearby structures.
The greater whirlwind affects creatures differently, depending on their size and where they are in relation to the twister.
Near the Tornado: Large or smaller creatures who start their turn within 60 feet of the center of the greater whirlwind must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dragged 1d4x;10 feet toward the center of the twister, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet dragged.
Huge creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone.
Gargantuan and Colossal creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save before moving away from the twister.
Flying creatures of size Huge or smaller that fail their Fortitude saves are sucked to the center of the twister, taking 2d6 points of damage from the battering and buffeting.
Gargantuan flying creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be pulled 1d6x;10 feet toward the center of the twister.
Colossal flyers must likewise make Fortitude saves or be pulled 1d6x;5 feet toward the twister's center.
Inside the Tornado: Creatures who start their turn inside the tornado take 6d6 points of damage for each of the 1d10 rounds they remain inside it (roll separately for each creature).
Creatures inside the tornado can't do much; attacks, spellcasting, and movement are impossible within an greater whirlwind.
When the greater whirlwind expels a creature, it reappears 4d6x;5 feet away from the twister's center in a random direction, and 4d6x;5 feet off the ground (immediately falling if it can't fly).
Terrain and Structures: The tornado uproots trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of dense rubble (as described on page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) wherever it goes.
Structures within a greater whirlwind take 2d6x;10 points of damage per round.
In a round or two, that is sufficient to destroy any building made of materials less sturdy than reinforced masonry.
No ranged attacks can pass through the twister.
The greater whirlwind extinguishes all flames it touches.
Listen checks are impossible within a greater whirlwind.
The greater whirlwind remains stationary unless you direct it elsewhere as a move action.
It moves up to 60 feet per round.
