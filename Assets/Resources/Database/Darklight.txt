The caster makes one creature or object radiate special darkness called darklight in a 5-foot-radius sphere.
This spell is most useful in a large, naturally dark area.
Within the darklight sphere, creatures that can normally see in the light can see, even though there is no light.
Only creatures and objects in the sphere can be seen, and only creatures in the sphere can see within the sphere, unless other observers can naturally see in the dark.
Thus, while two creatures in the sphere can see each other, a creature standing outside the sphere can neither see the creatures in the sphere (assuming it doesn't have darkvision), nor can it be seen by them.
A creature with darkvision standing outside the sphere could see those within the sphere, but those inside could not discern the creature.
The darklight spell's sphere is invisible in normal light and does not function in magical darkness.
