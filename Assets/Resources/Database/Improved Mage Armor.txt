You create an invisible but tangible field of force around the subject of the spell.
This provides an armor bonus to AC of +3 + 1 per 2 caster levels, to a maximum of +8 at 10th caster level.
Unlike mundane armor, improved mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction.
Since improved mage armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
Material Component: A tiny platinum shield worth at least 100 gp.
