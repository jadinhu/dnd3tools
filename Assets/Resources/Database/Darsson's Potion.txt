You transform the water in a flask so that it is capable of storing a spell in the manner of a potion.
On your next turn, you or another spellcaster can cast a
spell into the water, transforming the water into a potion of the appropriate type.
Only spells suitable for making potions can be used this way.
The person casting the spell to be stored must spend XP as if a potion were being created with the Brew Potion feat.
