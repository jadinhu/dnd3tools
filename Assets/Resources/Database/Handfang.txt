You create a fanged, biting mouth in the palm of your hand.
When you lay your hand upon a creature, the mouth deals
1d8 points of damage.
If the target makes a successful Reflex save, he takes only half damage.
If the target fails his Reflex save, you may start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If you establish a hold, the fanged mouth sinks its teeth into the target's flesh and continues to bite for an additional 1d6 points of damage each round until the hold is broken or the spell ends.
