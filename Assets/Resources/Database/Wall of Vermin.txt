Exuding the stench of festering carrion, waves upon waves of buzzing, clambering, clicking bugs roil up from beneath the earth.
You cause a thick but porous wall, alive with hungry bugs, to buzz and scuttle into existence.
It provides concealment in both directions, imposing a 20% miss chance on any attacks passing through it.
You cannot conjure the wall so that it occupies the same space as a creature.
Any living creature passing through the wall is subjected to hundreds of tiny bites.
It takes 2d6 points of damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.
Any creature becoming nauseated while moving through the wall can complete itsmove action, but cannot take a standard action in that round.
The wall of vermin is immune to weapon damage, though it can be affected by area spells and effects (such as burning hands or cone of cold).
It has 20 hit points and automatically fails any save.
Disintegrate has no effect on a wall of vermin, since it is not a single physical object, though any wind of 50 mph or greater breaks it up for 1 round.
Despite its appearance, a wall of vermin is not made up of natural creatures, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect animals or vermin.
