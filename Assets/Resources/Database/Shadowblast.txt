This spell is particularly effective against creatures native to the Plane of Shadow and those that use shadow in spells or spell-like abilities.
It clears the spell's area of any portals or weak spots between the Plane of Shadow and other planes, and it prevents access with shadow-based spells.
It appears as a flash of light in the area of effect.
Natives of the Plane of Shadow caught in a shadowblast are stunned for 3d6 minutes if they fail a Fortitude saving throw.
Shadow natives that are also undead or vulnerable to light take an additional 2d10 points of damage if they fail a second Fortitude save.
Creatures that fail either Fortitude save cannot use spell-like or supernatural abilities to open any portal to the Plane of Shadow for 3d6 minutes.
Shadowblast closes all portals, gates, and other openings to the Plane of Shadow, and any weak spots are strengthened.
Creatures on the other side of a portal are unaffected by shadowblast.
Material Component: A handful of grave dirt, squeezed tightly and flung.
