<b>You stomp your foot on the ground, creating a ripple of noise that unleashes suppressed sounds behind it.</b>
	
You create sonic vibrations that negate any magical silence effect in the area. This zone of negation moves with you and lasts as long as you continue to concentrate.
	
The silence effect is not dispelled but simply held in abeyance; it remains in effect outside the area of the joyful noise effect.
