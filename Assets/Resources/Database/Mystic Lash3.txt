You create a long whip of ghostly red energy that emanates from your hand and never harms you.
You can wield this weapon as if it were an actual whip and you were proficient with it.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the mystic lash to strike a target.
Any creature struck by it takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per three caster levels (maximum 4d6) and must succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.
You gain a bonus on damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier, but your Strength modifier does not apply, since the lash is immaterial.
If you release the lash from your hand after it hits a target, it continues to attack that target automatically, leaving your hand free.
If the lash's target falls unconscious, dies, or is destroyed, the lash returns to you on its next action.
If you do not grasp it on the round it returns, it dissipates; otherwise, you can use the lash on another creature and begin the cycle again.
As with a normal whip, you can use the mystic lash to make trip or disarm attacks, but only if you are actually wielding it.
It cannot make such attacks on its own.
