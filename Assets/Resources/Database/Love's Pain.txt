The caster blasts a lancelike projectile of greenish-black energy from his hand, striking a single foe as a ranged touch attack.
The energy does not harm the subject.
Instead, the subject's closest friend or dearest loved one is wracked with pain and takes 1d6 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d6).
There is no limit to the distance between the caster and the loved one, and the loved one gets no saving throw or spell resistance.
If the loved one is within an antimagic field, the spell has no effect.
It may take DMs and players a moment to determine who the subject's dearest loved one is.
The DM determines this for nonplayer characters (NPCs).
It is rare (but possible) that no individual qualifies.
In that case, the subject takes the damage.
Corruption Cost: 1d6 points of Intelligence damage.
