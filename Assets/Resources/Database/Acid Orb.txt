One or more orbs of acid about 3 inches across shoot from your palm at their targets.
You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your target.
The orbs deal a total of 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), divided any way you see fit, but a single orb must deal at least 1d6 points of damage.
You declare the damage division before making your attack rolls.
A creature struck directly takes the orb's damage and becomes nauseated from the acid's noxious fumes for 1 round.
A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half and negates the nausea.
If you miss, acid splashes in a 10-foot burst, dealing 2 points per die of damage dealt by that orb.
A successful Reflex reduces splash damage by half.
