Winter's embrace covers the victim with sheets of ice and lumps of snow.
If the subject succeeds on its Fortitude save, the ice and snow instantly slough from its body, causing a mere 1d4 points of cold damage and ending the effect.
If the subject fails its saving throw, the ice and snow cling tenaciously to its body and cause 1d8 points of cold damage each round.
On the subject's action each round, it can attempt a new Fortitude saving throw to avoid taking damage that round.
If a creature takes damage twice from a single casting of winter's embrace, it becomes fatigued.
The fourth time a creature takes damage from the same spell, it becomes exhausted.
