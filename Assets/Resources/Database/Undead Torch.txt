You cause a corporeal undead to give off cold blue energy that disrupts the life force of living creatures, but has no effect on objects or undead.
The target creature deals an extra 2d4 points of damage with its melee attacks.
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the subject of this spell attacks the creature.
If it succeeds, the creature is unaffected by that casting of undead torch.
If the subject of this spell is destroyed, the undead torch continues to burn at the location of its destruction until the duration of the spell expires, and creatures that pass through that area take damage.
If the subject of this spell assumes a noncorporeal state (such as a vampire's gaseous form), the spell disperses harmlessly.
Material Component: A living or dead firefly or glowworm.
