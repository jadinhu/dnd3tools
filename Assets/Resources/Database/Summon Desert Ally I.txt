This spell summons a dustform creature (see page 161).
It appears where you designate and acts immediately on your turn.
It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability.
If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.
Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.
This spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Desert Ally table.
You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.
All the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.
