A node lock spell cast upon an earth node magically &quot;locks&quot; it against others who might wish to use its power.
You can affect an earth node whose class is equal to one-half your caster level or less.
For any caster except you, the node lock adds +15 to each Spellcraft DC associated with the use of the node's standard powers.
A successful dispel magic breaks the node lock.
