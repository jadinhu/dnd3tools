You summon one or more giants that attack your enemies.
They appear where you designate and act immediately, on your turn.
The giants attack your opponents to the best of their ability.
If you speak Giant, you can direct the giants not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
Summoned giants act normally on the last round of the spell and disappear at the end of their turn.
Choose a giant kind from the table below.
Focus: A lock of hair from a giant of the desired kind.
