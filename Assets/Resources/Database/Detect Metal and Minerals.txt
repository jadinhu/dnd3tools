You can detect large accumulations of metals and other minerals, whether worked or unworked.
The spell will detect everything from a vein of iron ore to a pile of gold coins, even through solid stone or other barriers.
When you cast this spell, you must concentrate on at least 10 pounds of the metal or mineral you're searching for.
If an accumulation of that metal 10 pounds or larger is within the spell area, you will unerringly sense it (most coins are 50 to the pound).
The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area:
1st Round: Presence or absence of the particular metal or mineral.
2nd Round: Approximate weight of the metal or mineral.
3rd Round: Distance and direction (measured in a straight line) to the metal or mineral.
As long as the spell is active, you can change the metal or mineral you're trying to detect by simply concentrating on a different sample (it takes a standard action to refocus on the new sample).
Thus you could search for gold, then switch to adamantine, then seek out sources of iron.
If you stop concentrating on a sample, the spell ends.
If your sample is unworked, you will detect only unworked accumulations of the metal, such as ore deposits and mineral veins.
You will only detect worked metal, such as gold coins or mithral armor, if your sample is likewise refined.
Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area.
The spell can penetrate any nonmagical solid barrier.
Material Component: A 10-pound sample of the metal or mineral to be detected.
