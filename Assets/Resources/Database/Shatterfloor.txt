You create a loud, thrumming vibration that builds to a painful crescendo before fading.
Creatures and objects in the area take 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and can make a Will saving throw for half damage.
If the floor of the area is made of stone, wood, ice, or material any softer than those, the floor is pulverized to a depth of 6 inches, resulting in an area of soft dust, wood fragments, or loose crushed ice, as appropriate.
Any creature moving across this surface is reduced to half speed.
