You create a fanged, biting mouth in the palm of your hand.
When you lay your hand upon a creature, the mouth deals 1d6 points of damage.
If the target makes a successful Reflex save, she suffers only half damage.
If the target fails her Reflex save, you may start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If you establish a hold, the fanged mouth sinks its teeth into the target's flesh and continues to bite for an additional 1d6 points of damage each round until the hold is broken or the spell ends.
Additionally, the fanged mouth delivers venom to a grappled foe when you achieve a hold, dealing 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage (initial and secondary).
A Fortitude save negates each instance of the poison damage.
