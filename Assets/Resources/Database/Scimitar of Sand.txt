A curved, 3-foot-long blade of sand springs forth from your hand, screaming and churning like a caged sandstorm.
Attacks with a scimitar of sand are melee touch attacks.
The blade deals 1d6 points of damage, +1 point per two
caster levels (maximum +10).
The blade is not solid, so your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage.
You can use a scimitar of sand without penalty even if you lack proficiency with a normal scimitar.
In addition to being dealt damage, a creature struck by your weapon must succeed on a Fortitude save or become dehydrated.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of sand, salt, and iron filings.
