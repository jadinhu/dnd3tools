The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of living, glistening eyes of all different sizes and types to spring into being.
This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
It must always be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.
A wall of eyes is 1 inch thick per four caster levels.
The caster can double the wall's area by halving its
thickness.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.
A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached.
If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 +2 per inch of thickness.
Any creature touching the wall must succeed at a Will saving throw or be held motionless as if affected by a hold monster spell.
The wall magically consumes held creatures after 10 rounds, disintegrating them and adding more eyes to its mass.
At any time, from any distance (even across planes), the caster can take a standard action to look through the wall of eyes, seeing in all directions from the wall as if she were actually standing there.
Material Component: A single humanoid eye.
