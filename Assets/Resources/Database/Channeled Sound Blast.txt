You channel energy into the shimmering waves of sound spell, causing them to tremble and quake with power.
When you have poured enough energy into the spell, you send a thunderous blast into your foes.
This spell creates a cone of sonic energy that blasts your enemies.
The spell's strength depends on the amount of time you spend channeling energy into it.
If you cast channeled sound burst as a swift action, it deals 1d4 points of sonic damage per two levels in a 15-foot cone.
If you cast the spell as a standard action, it deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per level in a 30-foot cone.
If you cast channeled sound burst as a full-round action, it deals 1d8 points of sonic damage per level in a 30-foot cone.
If you spend 2 full rounds casting this spell, it deals 1d10 points of sonic damage per level in a 60-foot-radius spread and permanently deafens all creatures in the area that fail Fortitude saves.
Regardless of how long you spend casting this spell, it can't deal more than 10 dice of damage.
When you begin casting this spell, you decide when you are finished casting it after the appropriate time has passed.
You do not need to declare ahead of time how long you want to spend casting the spell.
