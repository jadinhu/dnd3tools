The caster holds forth his empty hand, and the still-beating heart of the subject appears within it.
The subject dies in 1d3 rounds, and only a heal, regenerate,
miracle, or wish spell will save it during this time.
The target is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to survive the attack.
If the target succeeds at the save, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level from general damage to the chest and internal organs.
(The target might die from damage even if it succeeds at the saving throw).
A creature with no discernible anatomy is unaffected by this spell.
Disease Component: Soul rot.
