This spell creates a whip of sonic energy that you wield as if you had proficiency with it. Simply cracking a sonic whip as a free action keeps normal animals (but not dire animals, magical beasts, or vermin) at bay unless they succeed on a Will save. Affected animals stay at least 30 feet away from you for the duration of the spell, as space permits. On a successful ranged attack with the whip, any normal animal you strike must succeed on a Will save or become frightened.
	
Against other creature types, you can use a sonic whip in combat as if it were a normal whip.
	
Material Component: A miniature silk whip.
