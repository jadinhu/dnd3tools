You complete the incantation and nearby shadows gather together, assuming your approximate size and shape.
You create a shadowy duplicate of yourself at a place you indicate within range.
The shadow double attacks any adjacent target (regardless of the weapon it appears to wield), as you desire, starting in the round when you cast the spell.
It attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + the modifier for your spell save DCs.
Each hit deals 1 point of Strength damage to the target.
The first time a target is hit, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect; this negates the damage and renders it immune to further attacks by the shadow double.
The shadow double occupies a space identical to yours.
It is not incorporeal, and thus can't share a space with another creature or object.
It can provide a flanking bonus against any creature that hasn't yet saved successfully against it.
The shadow double can strike incorporeal creatures, but not ethereal creatures.
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to direct the shadow double to attack any other target.
To attack this new target, the shadow double can move to any new legal space within 30 feet (it moves by instantaneous teleportation).
If it is not commanded to switch targets, it continues to attack the same target.
A shadow double can be attacked.
It has an Armor Class equal to 10 + your size modifier + a deflection bonus equal to the modifier for your spell save DCs, and has one-fifth of your full normal hit points.
If the shadow double is reduced to 0 hit points, or if you create a second shadow double when the first still exists, the spell ends.
