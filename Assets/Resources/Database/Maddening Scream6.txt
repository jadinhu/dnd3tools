This spell makes it impossible for the victim to do anything other than race about caterwauling. The creature must move its speed each turn, unless somehow prevented, and can take no other action. The spell gives the subject a -4 penalty to Armor Class, its Reflex saving throws fail except on a roll of 20, and the subject cannot use a shield.
