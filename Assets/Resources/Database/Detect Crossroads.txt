You can see fey crossroads within 60 feet, if your visibility isn't blocked.
A crossroads appears to you as a blue-hued, x-shaped shadow upon the ground.
You recognize the crossroads for what it is, and won't be fooled by a false or illusory one.
Detect crossroads gives you no information on where the backroad leads.
If the nearest crossroads is less than a mile away, but blocked visually from you either by distance or barriers, you can still sense its general direction.
Each round, you can turn to detect in a new direction.
See the previous chapter for more on crossroads.
