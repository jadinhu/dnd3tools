Your hand grows cold and darkens with the pulse of negative energy.
Your touch bestows negative energy on the target, dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and rendering it shaken for 1 round.
(Creatures immune to fear aren't shaken but are still subject to the spell's other effects).
Additionally, the target is permanently paralyzed if it fails a Fortitude save.
Creatures paralyzed in this fashion appear dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that they still live.
Dispel magic doesn't help a creature paralyzed by this spell, though remove paralysis or any effect that can remove a curse can free the victim.
