You fire a black ray of negative energy at a single target as a ranged touch attack.
Any creature struck by this ray takes 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (up to +20) and becomes dazed for 1 round.
A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the dazed effect.
The spell has no effect on constructs or inanimate objects.
Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures them of as much damage as it would ordinarily deal.
