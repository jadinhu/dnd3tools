The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct direction to a place of safety, with safety being defined as a location where the individual is not taking immediate damage from the environment, and immediate damage is not imminent.
It does not provide the means for the subject to move in that direction.
The safety spell points out the shortest distance out of a poisonous cloud, or the direction one should dig to reach the surface if entombed in earth.
It does not function against the maze spell, for that spell does no physical damage.
Nor does it have knowledge of or provide protection against the creatures that inhabit those safe places.
In the D&amp;D cosmology, safety has the following effects on specific planes: Plane of Shadow: Shortest route out of darklands.
Elemental Plane of Air:Nearest windproof shelter, shortest route out of smoke bank.
Elemental Plane of Earth: Nearest air pocket or open cavern.
Elemental Plane of Fire: Shortest route out of magma pools or other unusually hot places.
Elemental Plane of Water:Nearest pocket of breathable air; shortest route out of hot spot, ice pocket, or red tide.
Negative Energy Plane:Nearest doldrum area with the minor negative-dominant trait.
Positive Energy Plane:Nearest edge zone with the minor positive-dominant trait.
Limbo:Nearest area of stabilized Limbo.
Pandemonium:Nearest shelter from a windstorm.
Carceri: Shortest route out of a Minethys sandstorm.
Gehenna:Nearest flat ledge, nearest shelter from Mungoth's acidic snow.
Nine Hells:Nearest shelter from fireballs on Avernus, rockslides on Malbolge, or cold on Cania.
Acheron:Nearest shelter from Ocanthus bladestorms.
On planes you create yourself, safety may provide other information.
This spell is mostly used in hostile environments such as the Inner Planes to locate the nearest pocket of habitable space.
If safety is cast and then followed by a plane shift spell, the plane shift sends the caster to a place of relative safety on that plane.
The caster is transported to a pocket of air on the Elemental Plane of Water, for example, or a cool spot on the Elemental Plane of Fire.
