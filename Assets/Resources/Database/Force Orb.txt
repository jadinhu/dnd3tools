One or more globes of force about 3 inches across streak from your palm at their targets.
You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your target.
The orbs deal a total of 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), divided any way you see fit, but a single orb must deal at least 1d6 points of damage.
You declare the division of damage between targets before making your attack rolls.
A creature struck directly takes the orb's damage.
A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half.
If you miss, the orb explodes in a 10-foot burst, dealing 2 points per die of damage assigned to that orb.
A successful Reflex save reduces the burst damage by half.
