<b>You call across the boundaries of the multiverse, and the powers of Mechanus respond. The marut warps into place in an eyeblink with a whirling throb of thunder. &quot;Who denies death?&quot; it asks with the voice of an avalanche.</b>
	
By casting this spell, you receive the aid of a marut inevitable (<b>MM</b> 159). If you know an individual marut's name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, 
anyway).
	
You can ask the marut to perform one duty for you. The task must take no more than 1 hour to complete. The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task.
	
<b>XP Cost:</b> 500 XP.
