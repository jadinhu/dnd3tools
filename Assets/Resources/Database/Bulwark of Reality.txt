You utter your own truename, weaving its power into a matrix of force-tentacles that shimmer briefly, then descend around your form.
A faintly glowing silvery field of force surrounds you, providing you with a +6 armor bonus to Armor Class.
Unlike mundane armor, the bulwark of reality entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction.
Because the bulwark of reality is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak your own personal truename.
