Immense, partially translucent wings unfurl from behind you for an instant just before you jump, helping you achieve incredible distance or height.
You evoke immense, partially translucent wings that grant you a +20 circumstance bonus on a Jump check you make in the same round when you cast the spell.
In addition, if you are intentionally jumping down from a height and you succeed on the DC 15 Jump check to do so, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 30 fewer feet than you actually did.
Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, gains an additional +1 bonus on the Jump check for every two caster levels (maximum +10).
