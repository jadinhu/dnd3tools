You create an intangible image of a floating skull that trails black flames.
The skull and its flames are obviously an illusion and cause no damage, nor can the skull be damaged by attacks.
The skull flies at speed 40 feet (Perfect) but cannot move more than 20 feet from its point of origin.
The skull floats about aimlessly but threateningly within its available range.
You set two triggering conditions for the skull.
The first activates a message as if the skull were a magic mouth.
The second causes the skull to spit a tongue of flame 5 feet wide and 10 feet long that deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the creature that triggered it.
Those affected can make Reflex saving throws for half damage.
The triggering conditions can be the same for both effects, which would cause the skull to spit flame and speak its message at the same time.
Once both triggering conditions have been met, the skull disappears.
The skull can only do each effect one time, so if it has already spoken its message, it does not speak it again if the message trigger occurs a second time.
