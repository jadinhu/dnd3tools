Your back straightens, your eyes flash, and your aura pulses with divine might.
You channel a tiny spark of the divine, granting yourself nearly inhuman presence.
You gain a +5 sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus on Intimidate checks made against anyone who does not worship your deity.
When making such checks against individuals who have one alignment component opposed to yours (chaos/law or good/evil), this bonus becomes +10.
When making such checks against someone whose alignment is diametrically opposed to yours, the bonus becomes +15.
