<b>You strike your enemy with a resounding blow, capturing his attention. As he turns to look, you let loose with a string of oaths, challenges, and taunts that force him to focus his attention on you.</b>
	
As a White Raven adept, you are as much a tactician as you are a war leader. You learn to create openings for your allies to maximize the teamwork and esprit de corps that you foster. You know that for a group to succeed, it must work together, and that individual glory must be set aside so that the group can achieve victory.
	
As part of this maneuver, you make a melee attack against a single target you threaten. If your attack hits, you deal normal melee damage, and the target creature can?t make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. The opponent still threatens its normal area; it simply cannot make attacks of opportunity.</p
