<b>Mordenkainen's Trusted Bloodhound</b>(Complete Mage)

Conjuration (Creation)
 <b>Level:</b>  Assassin 4,  Sorcerer 6,  Wizard 6,    
<b>Components:</b>
 <b>Effect:</b> Phantom bloodhound

 	
You conjure a phantom hound, that can track and bring down your prey.
This spell functions like Mordenkainen's faithful hound,
except that the phantom bloodhound created can also track a creature as if it had the Track feat.
Its Survival modifier is equal to your caster level for this purpose, but it can't use the Survival skill for any other tasks.
A trusted bloodhound has a land speed equal to yours, and can move at full speed without taking a penalty on Survival checks to track.
A trusted bloodhound can't attack, provide a flank, or have any other effect on combat.
However, as a standard action, you can instruct a trusted bloodhound to serve as a watchdog; in this role it functions identically to Mordenkainen's faithful hound, except that its attack bonus equals your caster level.
You can command a trusted bloodhound to resume its tracking again as a standard action.
