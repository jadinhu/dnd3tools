You temporarily disrupt the bond between the target creature and a single legacy item it possesses.
The target loses access to all legacy abilities granted by that item.
For the duration of the spell, it cannot activate any of the item's legacy abilities, nor do any continuous effects of the legacy item grant any benefit to the target.
If the target has more than one legacy item, determine randomly which one is affected.
This effect cannot be dispelled, but it can be negated by break enchantment, remove curse, or any other effect that removes a curse.
