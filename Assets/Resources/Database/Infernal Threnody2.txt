You can strike up a pulsing, powerful rhythm that temporarily boosts the effective caster level of each evil-aligned divine spellcaster within range by +1.
This increase does not grant access to more spells, but it does improve all spell effects that are dependent on caster level.
In addition, infernal threnody mimics the effect of an unhallow spell with respect to turning or rebuking undead.
Within the spell's area, each evil-aligned divine spellcaster gains a +4 profane bonus on Charisma checks to rebuke undead, and each good-aligned divine spellcaster incurs a &#8211; 4 profane penalty on Charisma checks to turn undead.
Focus: The caster's instrument.
