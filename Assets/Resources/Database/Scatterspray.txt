You point to a collection of little, unsecured items and cause them to fly off in all directions simultaneously. The spray of items makes a burst with a 10-foot radius. If the items are fairly hard or sharp (such as stones, sling bullets, coins, broken glass, or the like), creatures in the burst take ld8 points of damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage. Eggs, fruit, and other soft objects deal nonlethal damage.
