You cause one creature to burst into flames.
The subject's clothing, items, hair and flesh burn with ferocity.
The fire deals 2d6 points of damage per round until the spell ends or the subject manages to extinguish the flames.
Flammable, nonmagical items carried by the target automatically fail their saves to resist this damage.
Against creatures lacking flammable flesh, hair, clothing, and items, the spell has no effect.
After the first round, the target can take a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking additional damage.
It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 15) to extinguish the flames.
Rolling on the ground allows the character a +2 bonus.
Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the flames.
Material Component: A gob of beeswax.
