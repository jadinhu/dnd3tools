<b>A fire flares from the ground, then subsides immediately. In the place of the first is the hunchbacked form of a barbazu, brandishing a saw-toothed glaive.</b>
	
This spell summons a bearded devil (MM 52) from the Nine Hells of Baator. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability. You must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect, but commanding the creature is a free action.
	
A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.
