<b>Bloodletting Strike</b>(Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords, p. 75)

Shadow Hand (Strike)
 <b>Level:</b>  Swordsage 5 (Two Shadow Hand maneuvers),    
<b>Components:</b>
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Melee attack
 <b>Target:</b> One creature
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial

 	
<b>Spinning your blade in a butterflylike pattern, you administer a dozen precise cuts in an eyeblink. Blood flows from your foe?s opened veins.</b>
	
As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. If this attack hits, your opponent takes 4 points of Constitution damage in addition to your attack?s normal damage. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15 + your Wis modifier) reduces this Constitution damage to 2 points, although the foe still takes full normal melee damage.</
