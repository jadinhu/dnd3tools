With a shriek of warping wood and scraping metal, your weapon grows, becoming far more intimidating.
A melee weapon you hold enlarges by one size category (Small weapons become Medium, Medium weapons become Large, and so on).
As its size increases, the damage the weapon deals increases as well (PH 114).
When your weapon is affected by this spell, you do not take a penalty for wielding an inappropriately sized weapon.
If you drop the enlarged weapon, are disarmed, or hand the weapon to another creature, the spell ends.
This spell does not grant you the ability to wield any other inappropriately sized weapon without penalty, only the one on which this spell is cast.
This spell has no effect on a weapon that is already increased in size by some other effect (such as being held by a creature affected by enlarge person).
