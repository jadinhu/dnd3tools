The object begins to glow with a phosphorescent white light.
Your companions' faces are illuminated, but they cast no shadows on the surrounding walls.
Ghost lantern causes an object to glow like a torch, shedding bright illumination in a 20-foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 20 feet) from the point you touch.
Unlike normal light spells, this light is only visible to you and a number of specifically designated creatures equal to one per three caster levels (maximum five).
These creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell but can later move as far apart as they want.
No others can see the ghost lantern; it has no effect on them, and they are affected by other ambient light conditions as normal.
Effectively, this spell allows you and your chosen companions to see in the dark.
Material Component: A bit of phosphorescent fungus.
