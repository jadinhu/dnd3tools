This spell creates one or more duplicates of you.
These duplicates share all your ability scores, personality, class levels, skills, feats, and memories.
They carry the same arms, armor, and equipment as you do (but only have mundane versions of your magical gear), and they cannot cast spells.
The duplicates you create have one-quarter of your hit point total at the time of casting.
They are obedient to you and friendly toward one another and your companions.
You may order them to take any actions, even ones that you would normally not take (such as charging the dragon or jumping off a cliff ).
They can do anything you can, except cast spells or use spell-completion or spell-trigger items.
They take damage as normal, but if one is slain, it disappears and you instantly take 10 points of damage.
At the end of the spell duration, all the duplicates (and any equipment created with them) disappear without causing damage to you.
The duplicates are completely indistinguishable from you.
Material Component: A few hairs from your head or beard.
