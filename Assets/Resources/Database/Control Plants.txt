This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant creatures for a short period of time.
You command the creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak.
Even if vocal communication is impossible (in the area of a silence spell, for instance), the controlled plants do not attack you.
At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.
Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.
