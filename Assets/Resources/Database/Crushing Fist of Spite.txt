A fist of darkness appears 30 feet above the ground and begins smashing down with incredible power.
All creatures and objects within the area take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
A successful Reflex saving throw reduces damage by half.
Each round, as a free action, the caster can direct the fist to another area within range, where it smashes downward again.
It continues to attack the same area unless otherwise directed.
The fist does not need to strike the ground.
It can attack airborne targets as well.
Airborne targets that succeed at a Reflex save take no damage and are forcibly ejected from the spell's area.
Material Component: A severed hand from a good-aligned humanoid cleric.
Disease Component: Festering anger.
