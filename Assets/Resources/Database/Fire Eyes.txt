Fire eyes grants the subject the ability to see through normal smoke, fire, and fog as if they weren't there.
While the spell functions, other creatures do not gain concealment from these effects with respect to the subject.
This spell does not enable a subject to see through magical fog, such as obscuring mist and fog cloud.
