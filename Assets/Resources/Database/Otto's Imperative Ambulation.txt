With seemingly no regard for his safety, your target begins moving around the battlefield.
For the duration of the spell, the subject must begin each of its turns by taking a move action to move at least 10 feet (provoking attacks of opportunity as normal).
The subject has full control over where it moves, as long as it ends up at least 10 feet from where it started.
If it is incapable of moving at least 10 feet with a move action � ;due to terrain or other obstacles � ;it is dazed for 1 round instead.
