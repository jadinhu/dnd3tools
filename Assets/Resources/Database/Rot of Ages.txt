A cloud of rotting plant and animal matter swirls up from the ground around your target, encompassing it in a whirlwind of decay.
This spell encompasses your target in a cloud of rotting debris.
The target is sickened for 2 rounds.
Furthermore, all other creatures are treated as having concealment against the target.
A successful Fortitude save negates the sickness, but not the concealment.
Nonliving creatures are unaffected by the sickness effect.
A living creature already under the effect of rot of ages that fails a save against a second casting of the spell is nauseated (rather than sickened) for as long as both effects last (and
then sickened for the remainder of the second spell's duration).
Special: A black dragon capable of casting 3rd-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
