<b>You call upon the forces of evil, and a heavy rain begins to fall in the area you indicate, its raindrops foul and steaming.</b>
	
A driving rain falls around you. It falls in a fixed area once created. The storm reduces hearing and visibility, resulting in a -4 penalty on Listen, Spot, and Search checks. It also applies a -4 penalty on ranged attacks made into, out of, or through the storm. Finally, it automatically extinguishes any unprotected flames and has a 50% chance to extinguish protected flames (such as those of lanterns). The rain damages good creatures, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round (good outsiders take double damage).
	
Material Component: A flask of unholy water (25 gp).
