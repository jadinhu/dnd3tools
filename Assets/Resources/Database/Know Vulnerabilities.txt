You learn any vulnerabilities and resistances the target creature has.
Vulnerabilities include anything that causes the creature more than the normal amount of damage (such as a creature with the cold subtype taking double damage from fire or a crystalline creature's vulnerability to the shatter spell).
Resistances include any effects that reduce or negate damage the creature takes and immunities to particular attacks.
The spell identifies resistances and vulnerabilities granted by spell effects.
For example, if cast upon an iron golem, you learn that it has all the construct defenses, damage reduction 50/+3, is slowed instead of damaged by electricity, is healed instead of damaged by fire, and is vulnerable to rust attacks.
If cast upon a balor, you learn that it has damage reduction 30/+3, spell resistance 28, is immune to poison and electricity, has acid, cold, and fire resistance 20, and does not have any particular vulnerabilities.
