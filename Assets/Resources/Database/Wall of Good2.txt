<b>You invoke the abjuration, and a cascade of brilliant white energy springs up in a wall that becomes invisible almost instantly.</b>
	
You create an immobile barrier that inhibits evil creatures. An evil summoned creature cannot pass through the wall in either direction, and any other evil creature must succeed on a Will save each time it attempts to move through the wall. If the saving throw is failed, the creature's movement is stopped, and it can take no other action that round.
	
A wall of good must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If it is cast so that an object or creature breaks its surface, the spell fails.
