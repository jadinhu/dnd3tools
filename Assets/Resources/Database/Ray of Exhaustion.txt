A black ray projects from your pointing finger.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.
The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell's duration.
A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only fatigued.
A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted.
This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted.
Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
Material Component: A drop of sweat.
