This spell allows the target to treat all of its natural attacks as silvered weapons.
The spell affects slam attacks, fist or claw attacks, bite attacks, and any other natural weapons the target creature possesses.
The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage, however.
Silvered claws can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
