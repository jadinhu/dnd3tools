A radiance of shimmering jade color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to maho and other evil magic, and blinding Tainted and Shadowlands creatures when they strike the subjects.
This abjuration has four effects.
First, the warded creatures gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves.
Unlike protection from Taint, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by Tainted creatures.
Second, the warded creatures gain SR 25 against evil spells and spells cast by maho-tsukai, oni, or other Tainted or Shadowlands creatures.
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from Taint does.
Finally, if a creature with a Taint score or the Shadowlands subtype succeeds at a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as blindness/deafness, but against jade aura's save DC).
Focus: A tiny statue carved from jade, representing one of the Seven Fortunes.
The statue costs at least 500 gp.
