You call on the power of the waste to counter and dismiss water creatures, spells, and effects.
However, dispel water cannot counter an instantaneous spell or effect.
You choose to use dispel water in one of three ways: to dry up a body of water, to counter a water-based spell or effect, or to dismiss an extraplanar creature of the water subtype.
Dry Up Water: This effect instantly destroys 200 cubic feet of water per level.
Remaining water rushes in to fill the void.
Cast in a large body of water, such as an ocean, the destruction of 1,000 or more cubic feet of water produces a strong current that pulls boats and creatures down.
Creatures caught in the current must make a DC 20 Swim check to avoid going under.
A creature that fails the Swim check is pulled down to a depth of 10 feet per caster level and must hold its breath or begin to drown (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
The current might capsize vessels: The chance is 95% for a craft shorter than 20 feet long, 50% for one from 20 to 60 feet long, and 20% for one over 60 feet long.
Counterspell:Used in this way, dispel water targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (see page 170 of the Player's Handbook).
It only counters spells and spell-like abilities that have the water descriptor, or appear on the Water domain spell list, or clearly involve water (such as create food and water, sleet storm, and wall of ice).
To successfully counter the other spell, you must make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level.
Dismiss Water Creature: Cast in this way, dispel water targets a single extraplanar creature of the water subtype within range.
The creature can negate the effect with a successful Will save (and its spell resistance, if any, applies).
If it fails to save or resist the spell, the creature is forced back to its home plane.
