<b>You press the bit of blackened bone against your foe and intone the spell. The bone vanishes, leaving a mottled bruise where it touched.</b>
	
You create a lingering decay in the spirit and body of the target. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1 point of Constitution damage each round while the spell lasts (maximum 5 points). The victim can attempt a Fortitude saving throw each round, and success negates the Constitution damage for that round and ends the spell.
