Your target's voice rends the air around her, shredding her from within.
Each time the subject casts a spell with a verbal component, she deals 2d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures within 10 feet of her (including herself).
She must then succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + damage dealt + spell level) to avoid losing the spell.
