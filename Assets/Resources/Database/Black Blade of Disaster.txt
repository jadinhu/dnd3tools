You create a black blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet long.
The blade strikes at any creature within its range, as you desire, starting on the round you cast the spell.
The blade makes a melee touch attack against its designated target once each round.
Its attack bonus is your base attack bonus plus your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively).
Anything hit by the blade takes 2d12 points of damage (bypassing the hardness of objects).
The blade threatens a critical hit on an 18-20 and is considered a +5 weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.
On a successful critical hit, the target suffers the effects of a disintegrate spell in addition to the normal damage from the blade.
It can pass through any magical barrier equal to or less than its spell level, but cannot penetrate dead magic areas or an antimagic field.
It can harm ethereal and incorporeal creatures as if it were a force effect.
The blade always strikes from your direction.
It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.
If the blade exceeds its range or goes out of your line of sight, the spell ends.
You may direct the blade to attack another target as a standard action.
A gate spell can be used to counterspell a black blade of disaster.
A dimensional anchor spell cast at the blade dispels it automatically.
The blade cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation can affect it.
Its touch attack AC is 13.
