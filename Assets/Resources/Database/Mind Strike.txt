<b>You strike your opponent?s head, rattling his senses and causing him to lose focus.</b>
	
As a warrior who fights with your mind as well as your brawn, you know that attacking a foe?s senses is just as valuable as sapping his strength. With this attack, you leave an opponent befuddled and vulnerable.
	
As part of this maneuver, make a melee attack. If this attack hits, your target must make a Will save (DC 14 + your Str modifier) or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. The target ignores the Wisdom damage on a successful save but still takes weapon damage normally.</
