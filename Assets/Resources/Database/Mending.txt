Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps, such as might be caused by a warp wood spell).
It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists.
Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new.
A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by mending.
The spell can repair a magic item, but the item's magical abilities are not restored.
(For restoring a broken magic item's abilities, see the item creation feats in Chapter 5: Feats).
The spell cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).
