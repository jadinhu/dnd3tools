<b>You finish the last detail and lean back to look at your work. The tattoo looks good. It should prove useful.</b>
	
This spell creates a single magic tattoo. You determine the exact type of tattoo, though the selection is limited by your caster level, as indicated below. You must possess a modicum of artistic talent to sketch the desired tattoo &#8211; at least 1 rank on Craft (drawing), Craft (painting), Craft (calligraphy), or a similar Craft skill. Inscribing a magic tattoo requires a successful Craft check. The DC varies with the kind of tattoo, as noted below.
	
If you are a 3rd- to 6th-level caster, you can inscribe a tattoo that generates any one of the following effects (Craft DC 10).
	
+2 resistance bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will).+1 luck bonus on attack rolls.+1 deflection bonus to AC.
	
At 7th to 12th caster level, you can add the following tattoos to the list that you can inscribe (Craft DC 15).
	
+2 resistance bonus on saving throws.+2 competence bonus on attack rolls.
	
When your caster level reaches 13th, you can add the following to the list of tattoos you can inscribe (Craft DC 20).
	
Spell resistance equal to 10 + 1 per three caster levels.+2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score+1 spellcaster level. This effect increases the subject's effective level, but not the total number of spells. For example, an 11th level caster who receives this tattoo functions as a 12th-level casater for the purpose of determining level-based spell variables (such as range, area, effect, and so on), but he does not receive any extra spells.
	
A single creature can have only three magic tattoos at a time. Any attempt to apply more than that automatically fails.
	
A successful <b>erase</b> spell removes a single magic tattoo. A successful <b>dispel magic</b> spell can remove multiple magic tattoos if targeted on the creature bearing them.
	
<b>Material Components:</b> Tattoo inks in appropriate colors costing at least 100 gp.
	
<b>Focus:</b> Tattoo needles.
