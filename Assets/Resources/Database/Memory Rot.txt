You create a cloud of spores that infests the brain of the subject creature, gradually destroying the creature's mind.
The spores permanently drain 1d6 points of Intelligence immediately.
Each round thereafter, the spores gradually eat away at the subject's brain, permanently draining 1 additional point of Intelligence.
The subject may roll a Fortitude save each round to combat the effects of the spores.
A successful save ends the spores' advance and halts any further loss of Intelligence.
