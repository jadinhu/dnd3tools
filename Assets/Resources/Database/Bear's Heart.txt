You turn your living allies (one per caster level) into fierce warriors, but exhaust them in the process.
Allies gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, and also +1d4 temporary hit points per caster level.
When the spell ends, any remaining temporary hit points from its effect are lost, and each ally takes 1 point of subdual damage per level of the caster.
