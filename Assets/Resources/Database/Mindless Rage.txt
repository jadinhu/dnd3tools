You fill the subject with so great a rage that it can do nothing but focus on engaging you in personal physical combat.
The target must be able to see you when you cast this spell.
If the subject later loses line of sight to you, the spell immediately ends.
(A subject can't voluntarily break line of sight with you, such as by closing its eyes, to end this spell prematurely).
If the subject threatens you, it must make a full attack against you using its melee weapons or natural melee attacks.
If the subject doesn't threaten you, it must move at up to twice its speed, ending its movement as close to you as possible.
If it moves close enough with a single move to threaten you, it may stop and make a melee attack against you as normal.
While under the effect of a mindless rage spell, the subject can make use of all normal melee combat skills, abilities, and feats ï¿½ ;either offensive or defensive.
However, the subject can't make ranged attacks, cast spells, or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger, or spell completion to function.
The subject can't make any attack against a creature other than you.
The subject of this spell, though overcome with rage, is by no means rendered idiotic or suicidal.
For example, an affected creature will not charge off a cliff in an attempt to reach you.
An interesting side effect of mindless rage occurs when the spell affects any character or creature with the rage ability (such as a barbarian).
In these cases, the mindless rage spell automatically activates the character's rage ability (and counts as one of the character's uses of rage for that day).
Focus: A scarlet handkerchief or similar piece of cloth, waved in the target's direction while you vocalize the verbal component.
