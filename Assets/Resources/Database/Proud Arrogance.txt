This spell lets a group of creatures resist effects that convince them they should not be following their present course of action.
The creatures affected gain a +4 resistance bonus on saves against charm, compulsion, and fear effects.
The proud arrogance spell only functions for creatures of the same race as the caster.
In other words, a human wizard casting the spell can target only humans with it.
Material Component: A piece of polished brass.
