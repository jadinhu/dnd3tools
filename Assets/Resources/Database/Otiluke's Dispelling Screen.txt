You create an opaque, immobile, shimmering screen of violet energy.
Any spell effect operating on a creature or unattended object that passes through the screen is affected as by a targeted dispel magic at your caster level.
Attended items that pass through are not affected by the screen, which is the only way the screen differs from a normal targeted casting of dispel magic ï¿½ ;attended items are essentially not targeted by the screen.
Make a caster level check (1d20 + 1 per caster level, maximum +10) to dispel spell effects (DC 11 + caster level) or suppress an unattended object's magical properties for 1d4 rounds (DC equal to the item's caster level).
Spell effects not operating on objects or unattended creatures cannot pass through the screen.
A disintegrate or successful dispel magic removes Otiluke's dispelling screen, while an antimagic field suppresses it.
Material Component: A sheet of fine lead crystal.
