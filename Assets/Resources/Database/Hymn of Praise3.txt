You can strike up a rousing, inspirational song that temporarily boosts by 2 the effective caster level of each good-aligned divine spellcaster within range. This increase does not grant access to additional spells, but it does improve all spell effects that are dependent on caster level. Within the spell's area, each good-aligned divine spellcaster gains a +4 sacred bonus on Charisma checks to turn undead, and each evil-aligned divine spellcaster takes a -4 sacred penalty on Charisma checks to rebuke undead.
