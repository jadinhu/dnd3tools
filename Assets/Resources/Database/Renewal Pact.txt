This spell creates a pact between the target and a deity that uses divine energy to wipe away any of a host of conditions that may afflict the target.
Once this spell is cast, the pact remains dormant until the target is subjected to one or more of the following adverse conditions: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded,
insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, or poisoned.
One round after the target is affected by a condition that triggers the renewal pact, the target receives a heal spell (caster level equal to the caster of the renewal pact.
A creature can be subject to only one renewal pact at a time.
Casting renewal pact on a target who already has an untriggered renewal pact voids the earlier pact.
XP Cost: 500 XP.
