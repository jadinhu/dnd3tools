You shroud yourself with invisible negative energy so that nonintelligent undead perceive you as a fellow undead creature, ignoring you.
Your appearance does not change, and while intelligent undead do not immediately recognize you as alive, they are likely to question whether you are actually undead.
If used in conjunction with a disguise or an illusion to appear undead, this spell gives you a +5 bonus on your Disguise check.
If you attack an undead creature while this spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends.
When using this spell, inflict spells heal you and cure spells hurt you.
You are treated as if you were undead for the purpose of all spells and effects.
A successful turn (or rebuke) attempt against an undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + cleric's Charisma modifier) or be panicked (or cowering) for 10 rounds.
A turn attempt that would destroy (or command) undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will save (DC 15 + cleric's Charisma modifier) or be stunned (or charmed as with charm monster) for 10 rounds.
Material Component: Dust or bone fragments from any destroyed undead creature.
