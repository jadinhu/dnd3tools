This spell sends a powerful signal to the soul of a creature that has died and not yet manifested on the Material Plane or passed on to the True Afterlife.
The soul immediately appears on the Ethereal Plane and can immediately make a Wisdom check with a +10 morale bonus to manifest on the Material Plane.
If that check is failed, the ghost may make Wisdom checks normally every minute to manifest.
