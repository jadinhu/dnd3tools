You transform a single melee weapon, thrown weapon, or group of projectiles into a weapon of brilliant energy.
A brilliant energy weapon sheds light as a torch (20-foot radius) and ignore nonliving matter.
Armor bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor.
(Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply).
A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects.
If this spell is cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the effect on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.
Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.
