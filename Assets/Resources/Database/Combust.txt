This spell makes a combustible object or a creature's combustible equipment burst into flame, even if damp.
If the target is a creature, the initial eruption of flame causes 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) with no saving throw.
The creature must make a Reflex save (DC 15) or catch on fire.
(See Catching on Fire in Chapter 3 of the <span class="caps">DUNGEON</span> MASTER's Guide).
If the target is a combustible, unattended object, the initial eruption of flame inflicts fire damage on the object as noted above.
The object catches fire and takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until consumed or someone puts out the fire.
Anyone touching the object during the initial eruption of flame takes the same fire damage the object does.
A Reflex save reduces damage by half.
If a creature touching the object fails the Reflex save, it must make another Reflex save (DC 15) to avoid catching fire.
This spell originally appeared in Magic of FaerÃ»n.
Material Component: A drop of oil and a piece of flint.
