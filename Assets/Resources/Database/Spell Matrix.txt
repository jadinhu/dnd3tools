This spell functions like <b>lesser spell matrix</b>, except that you can store up to two spells of up to 3rd level, and you take 2d6 points of damage instead of 1d6 upon casting. The matrix closes after 2 rounds and no more spells can be added, even if it is not full.
	
In addition, you can decide to link the two spells stored in the matrix into a spell sequence if both are 2nd level or lower. You can then discharge the two linked spells as a single swift action, just as if you were casting the lone spell from a spell matrix.
	
Focus: A sapphire with a minimum value of 1,000 gp.
