<b>Hissing an evil laugh, you sprout sharp fangs to drain the blood of your foes.</b>
	
You grow vampirelike fangs that allow you to make bite attacks as natural attacks. Your bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage + your strength modifier, and 1 point of Constitution damage. If you make a full attack with other weapons, you can make a bite attack as a natural secondary attack (-5 penalty on the attack roll).
