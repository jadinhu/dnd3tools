<b>A blue, dancing flame appears on your weapon. As you strike your foe, this flame slides off your weapon and covers your enemy in raging fire.</b>
	
You make a single melee attack that deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage. In addition, if your strike hits, the flames upon your weapon bind to the target, which takes an extra 2d6 points of fire damage each round at the start of its turn for 3 rounds.
This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
