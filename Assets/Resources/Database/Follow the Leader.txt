Like the legendary piper, you can play a tune so beguiling that those who hear it feel compelled to follow along behind you, dancing merrily.
You can lure up to 1 HD of eligible creatures for each bard level you possess, up to a maximum of 10 HD.
Those with the fewest hit dice are the first to be affected.
Once you have reached your limit of creatures, the music does not affect any others.
Creatures thus captivated can defend themselves but do not initiate attacks.
If you lead your followers directly into danger, each is allowed another Will save to avoid walking off a cliff, stepping into deep water, or the like.
Focus: The caster's instrument.
