You speak a mildly revolting word of power.
You utter a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of your choice to become sickened, whether the creature can hear the word or not.
The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total, as shown below.
Any creature that currently has 101 or more hit points is unaffected by power word sicken.
