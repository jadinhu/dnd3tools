You can sense the presence of a favored enemy.
The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.
1st Round: Presence or absence of a favored enemy in the area.
2nd Round: Types of favored enemies in the area and the number of each type.
3rd Round: The location and HD of each individual present, as though revealed by a power sight effect.
Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area.
The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
