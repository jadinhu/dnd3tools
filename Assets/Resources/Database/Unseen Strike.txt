You strike your foe, then immediately fade from sight.
This spell has no immediate effect upon you.
However, the next time you deliver a successful melee attack, you instantly turn invisible (as the invisibility spell).
If you do not make a successful melee attack within 1 hour per level of casting the spell, the effect ends.
