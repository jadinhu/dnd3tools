An immobile, opaque curtain of frosty coldfire springs into existence.
One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of cold, dealing 2d4 points of cold damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of cold damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet.
The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area.
In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of frostburn damage +1 point of frostburn damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it.
If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.
The opaqueness of the coldfire grants concealment (20% miss chance) against attacks made from the opposite side of the wall.
If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of fire damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out.
(Do not divide fire damage by 4, as for normal objects).
Wall of coldfire can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
A permanent wall of coldfire that is extinguished by fire damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.
Coldfire Component: Three ounces of coldfire.
