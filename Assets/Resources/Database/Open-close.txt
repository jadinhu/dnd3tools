You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container.
If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails.
In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less.
Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.
Focus: A brass key.
