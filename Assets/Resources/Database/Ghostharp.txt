You prepare an object that records and replays a song previously played or sung in its vicinity.
When cast, the spell searches a radius of 50 feet for the lingering notes of a tune played there within the last day.
It records these notes and reverberations.
If multiple songs have been played at that spot, ghostharp recalls the song most recently played, starting with the beginning of the piece recalled.
At your verbal command, &quot;Play&quot;, the ghostharp replays the music.
The tune repeats until you command it to stop, or until the spell's duration comes to an end.
The ghostharp does not record conversations.
Its imperfect replay can't reproduce bardic music or other magical effects, nor can it cast spells.
