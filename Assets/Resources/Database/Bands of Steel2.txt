<b>The interlocking hoops become briefly hot then disappear even as similar, larger bands streak from your outstretched hand toward the creature you indicate. With a satisfying metallic clank, the bands wrap around the indicated creature.</b>
	
The victim must succeed on a Reflex save or be immobilized and thus unable to move. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim is only partially trapped by the bands, and is entangled.
	
A creature immobilized by the bands can attempt to escape as a full- round action, either by bursting free
(Strength DC 18) or wriggling out (Escape Artist DC 18).
	
An entangled creature can use a full- round action to break free (Strength DC 13) or disentangle itself (Escape Artist DC 13).
	
<b>Material Component</b>: Three small silver hoops, interlocked.
