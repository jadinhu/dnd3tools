This potent spell opens your senses to the Weave, allowing you to perceive its very fabric as clearly as you might see the trees in a forest while standing in the heart of it.
When a spell is cast, you can visually observe its effects on the Weave.
Thanks to this heightened understanding, you can use the counterspell action to do much more than merely counter another caster's spell.
Srinshee's spell shift grants you a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify spells for counterspelling.
Furthermore, instead of simply negating the effect of a spell you successfully counter, you can choose from among the following options as long as Srinshee's spell shift lasts.
Aid: You can boost the effectiveness of an ally's spell by applying any one metamagic feat from the following list: Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Maximize Spell, or Widen Spell.
To use this option, you must expend a spell slot (or sacrifice a prepared spell) whose spell level equals or exceeds that of the ally's spell with the desired metamagic feat applied.
For example, empowering an ally's fireball would require you to expend a 5th-level or higher spell slot.
Manipulate: You can seize control of the spell's range, area, or targets, as appropriate, and reshape these factors as you choose.
For example, you could cause an enemy wizard's fireball to explode at his feet, or you could cause his haste spell to target your allies within the area he has specified.
Only one property of the spell, chosen from among those that the caster can normally designate, can be manipulated in this manner.
For example, you could not choose the targets of a sleep spell because the targets affected are determined by the spell itself, not the caster.
Backlash: You counter the spell as normal, but your opponent must succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds.
