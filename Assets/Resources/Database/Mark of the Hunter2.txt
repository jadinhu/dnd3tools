<b>By pointing your finger at one of your favored enemies, you mark it with a glowing rune that only you can see.</b>
	
Your favored enemy bonuses against a foe with a mark of the hunter are 4 higher than they would otherwise be.
	
Furthermore, the rune limns your enemy, making the foe easier for you to attack. The subject of a mark of the hunter spell gains no bonus to Armor Class against your attacks from any cover less than total cover, nor does it gain a miss chance against your attacks from any concealment less than total concealment. Other effects that grant a miss chance (such as incorporeality) work normally.
	
Material Component: A bit of skin or bone from the relevant favored enemy type or subtype.
