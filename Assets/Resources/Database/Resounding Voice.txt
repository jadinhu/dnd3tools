The subject becomes supernaturally loud, and his voice carries over long distances.
A creature speaking or singing with the aid of resounding voice can be heard clearly up to 100 feet away per caster level.
Creatures within an area of magical silence cannot hear the subject, and a subject within a silence effect cannot be heard at all.
Resounding voice counters and dispels silence and is also countered and dispelled by silence.
