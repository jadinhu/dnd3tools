<b>As you complete this spell, a swath of pale moonlight springs from your hand.</b>
	
On your turn each round, you can change the direction the cone of light points.
	
Light from a moonbeam spell does not adversely affect creatures that are sensitive to light, but lycanthropes in humanoid form caught in the cone must make a Will save to avoid involuntarily assuming their animal forms. A lycanthrope in animal form can change out of it on the creature's next turn (spending a round in animal form). However, if it is still in the area of the spell, it must succeed on a Will save to do so. Once a lycanthrope successfully saves against moonbeam, it is not affected by any more of your moonbeam spells for 24 hours.
	
Moonbeam penetrates any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but does not counter or dispel it. Darkness spells of higher level block a moonbeam.
	
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of white powder.
