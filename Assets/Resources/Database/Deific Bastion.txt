Calling upon your patron for protection, you imbue your defenses with an unnatural resilience.
You must either be holding a shield or wearing heavy armor to cast this spell.
The shield or armor gains a +1 enhancement bonus plus an additional special ability that depends on your deity, as given on the table below.
This enhancement bonus is defensive only; it does not cause a shield to function as a magic weapon if it is used to make a shield bash.
The enhancement bonus of the armor or shield is +2 if your caster level is 9th-11th, +3 if it's 12th-14th level, +4 if it's 15th-16th, and +5 if it's 18th or higher.
