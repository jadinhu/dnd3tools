Red blood erupts along the weapon's blade, bludgeon, or point.
The blood drips to spatter in thick, viscous drops upon the ground.
This spell infuses the weapon touched with baleful energy.
The next time this weapon strikes a living creature, blade of blood discharges.
The spell deals an extra 1d6 points of damage against the target of the attack.
You can voluntarily take 5 hit points of damage to empower the weapon to deal an extra 2d6 points of damage (for a total of 3d6 points of extra damage).
The weapon loses this property if its wielder drops it or otherwise loses contact with it.
