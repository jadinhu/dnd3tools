You touch the creature with your hand, and it teeters on the edge of unconsciousness.
You draw a cloud over the subject's mind, dealing 3d6 points of nonlethal damage.
No saving throw is allowed against this effect.
Each round on its turn, the subject must succeed on a Will save or take another 3d6 points of nonlethal damage.
If the saving throw is successful, the damage for that round is negated and the spell ends.
