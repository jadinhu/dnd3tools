A single word from your lips overwhelms your foe's hearing.
You utter a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of your choice to become deafened, whether the creature can hear the word or not.
The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total, as shown below.
Any creature that currently has 101 ormore hit points is unaffected by power word deafen.
