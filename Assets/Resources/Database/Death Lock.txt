If the subject creature dies while the spell is in effect, its soul immediately passes on to the True Afterlife and cannot form a ghost.
The subject can still be raised from the dead or even brought back as a ghost by magic (such as with the raise ghost spell); this spell only prevents a newly slain creature from forming a ghost of its own volition.
