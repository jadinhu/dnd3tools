<b>Diamondsteel</b> enhances the strength of one suit of metal armor. The armor provides damage reduction equal to half the AC bonus of the armor. This damage reduction can be overcome only by adamantine weapons. For example, a suit of full plate would provide damage reduction 4/adamantine, and a <b>+1 breastplate</b> (+6 AC) would provide damage reduction 3/adamantine.
