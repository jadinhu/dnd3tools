A mystic shield of beneficent energies interposes itself between you an incoming magical attack.
The shield blocks harmful spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.
It can only block one such attack each round, intercepting the first but not any later attacks until your next turn.
Any targeted magical attack that strikes the shield is dissipated, but it has a 5% chance per spell level to shatter the shield as well.
Attacks with no spell level have a 5% chance per 2 caster levels to shatter the shield.
An attack that shatters the shield is dissipated without harming you.
If you are within the area or effect of a harmful spell or effect that is not directly targeted on you, the shield of the archons grants you a +4 bonus on your saving throw against the effect.
