You can convert an unused usage of your higher-order planar touchstone ability into a ray of electricity (see the Planar Touchstone feat, page 41).
This ray exhausts one use of your higher-order ability and deals 5d6 points of electricity damage to the target with a successful ranged touch attack.
For every five levels gained above 7th, you may fire one additional ray of electricity (to a maximum of three rays at 17th level).
Each ray exhausts one of your higher-order ability uses.
