You sacrifice a small part of your own life force to create a new lantern archon (see page 16 of the Monster Manual) in the service of your patron.
The lantern archon is not under your control but is friendly to you.
It willingly performs one nonhazardous task of your choice taking up to 1 hour without requiring any payment.
Alternatively, you can request that it perform a hazardous or longer task, but in this case payment is required ï¿½ ;see lesser planar ally, page 261 of the Player's Handbook, for details on tasks and payment.
Upon completion of the task, the lantern archon is magically transported to your deity's home plane.
Sacrifice Component: 1d2 points of Constitution drain.
