<b>As you foe struggles to ready his defenses, you make a subtle gesture in the air. A noose formed of shadow drops from above him, wraps around his throat, and hoists him aloft. His limbs flail as he struggles to free himself from the strangling noose.</b>
	
As part of this maneuver, you form a noose of shadow that wraps around your target and strangles him. This maneuver works only against a flatfooted target. As part of this maneuver, you make a ranged touch attack against a flat-footed creature within range. If it hits, your opponent takes 8d6 points of damage. In addition, he must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 16 + your Wis modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. A successful save negates the stun, but not the extra damage. This strike has no effect against nonliving creatures, such as constructs and undead.
	
This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
