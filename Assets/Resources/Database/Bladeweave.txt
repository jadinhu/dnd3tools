A bladeweave spell imbues your melee attacks with a fascinating pattern or rhythm that entrances your opponent.
Any round that you attack with a melee weapon, you can make a single additional touch attack with that weapon at your normal attack bonus as a free action.
This attack deals no damage.
Instead, anyone successfully touched by the weapon must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round.
Spell resistance applies to this effect.
