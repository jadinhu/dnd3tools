This spell heightens the subject's senses and awareness of danger.
The subject gains a +4 insight bonus on Listen and Spot checks and gains uncanny dodge for the duration of the spell, retaining its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker.
(The subject still loses its Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized).
