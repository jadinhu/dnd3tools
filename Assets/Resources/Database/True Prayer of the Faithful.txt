Raising your eyes to the skies, you concentrate on a brief prayer using the true language of the universe, using truename power to ask for the favor of your patron deity.
A flashing, brassy mote of energy spins around those you target.
When you cast true prayer of the faithful, you ask your patron deity to give your allies (possibly including yourself) a measure of divine aid.
The subjects of this spell gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks.
This spell automatically affects a single target if you succeed on the required Truespeak check.
But the higher your Truespeak check result, the more creatures you can affect (see below).
Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must correctly speak a truename associated with your deity.
You learn this truename when you learn this spell.
It's not your deity's truename, but a term associated with divine assistance.
The Truespeak DC is 20, and you can have the true prayer of the faithful affect one additional creature for every 5 points by which you exceed the Truespeak DC.
In addition, you gain an extra round of duration for every personal truename of a target creature you speak during the casting of the spell; your patron deity is better able to identify and assist your friends if you tell the deity their personal truenames.
