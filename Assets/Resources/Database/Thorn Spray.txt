You hurl a thorny plant in the direction of the targets.
The spell transforms the plant's small thorns into a spray of thorns that deals damage to the targets you select.
You make a normal ranged attack against each target separately, taking no penalty for lack of proficiency.
The thorns deal a total of 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), but you can divide this damage among the targets you select.
You must choose how to divide the damage before making your attack rolls.
Thus, an 8th-level caster can target a single creature with an attack that deals 8d6 points of damage on a successful hit, two creatures for 4d6 points of damage each, four creatures for 2d6 points of damage each, and so on.
You may divide the damage as you wish.
A creature that takes damage from the thorns is wracked with pain as though its body were covered with stinging nettles, and it is also sickened for 2d4 rounds.
A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect.
