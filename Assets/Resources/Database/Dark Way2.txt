<b>You stand at the edge of the canyon and invoke the power. At your feet appears a thin black bridge that arches over the canyon.</b>
	
You create a ribbonlike, weightless unbreakable bridge. A <b>dark way</b> must be anchored at both ends to solid objects, but otherwise can be at any angle. Like a <b>wall of force</b> (<b>PH 298</b>), it must be continuous and unbroken when formed. It is typically used to cross a chasm or a hazardous space. Creatures can move on a <b>dark way</b> without penalty, since it is no more slippery than a typical dungeon floor.
	
A <b>dark way</b> can support a maximum of 200 pounds per caster level. Creatures that cause the total weight on a dark way to exceed this limit fall through it as if it weren't there. You never fall through a <b>dark way</b> unless your own weight exceeds the spell's maximum capacity.
 <b>Also appears in</b>   Magic of Faerun
