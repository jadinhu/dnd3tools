Choose one of your natural weapons (your bite, a single claw, a wing, a crush, a tail slap, or a tail sweep).
For the duration of the spell, that natural weapon deals damage as though you were one size larger than your actual size.
You cannot gain additional attack forms (such as a tail slap) by using this spell; you can only improve attacks you already possess.
This spell does not stack with itself.
This spell's name derives from a marked preference among dragons for improving their bite attacks with this spell, but it works equally well on claw, wing, tail, and crush attacks.
