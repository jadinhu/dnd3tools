You cause a vertical wall of swirling water to appear.
You can double the area of the wall's effect by halving its thickness.
Any creature attempting to pass through a square occupied by a wall of water must make a Swim check (DC 14 + your spellcasting ability modifier) or become trapped in the water, unable to move.
A creature trapped in this fashion can attempt another Swim check each round and might drown (see Drowning, page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
If you conjure the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature must make a Swim check or become trapped; those that succeed can choose on which side they wish to emerge from the water.
Any nonmagical flame is extinguished if carried through a wall of water.
Few forms of physical attack can harm a wall of water directly.
Thrown weapons are ineffective through it, and attacks with other ranged weapons are made with a -2 penalty for every 5 feet of wall through which they must pass (in addition to normal range penalties; minimum penalty -2).
A breach in the wall closes immediately after the attack that made it goes through.
The water blocks line of effect for any fire spell.
Creatures on one side of the wall have cover against those on the other side unless the creature making the attack is under the effect of freedom of movement.
If any 5-foot section of water takes 20 or more points of fire damage in a single round, that section evaporates into steamy fog that lasts for 1 minute.
If any 5-foot section of wall takes 20 or more points of cold damage in 1 round, that length freezes for 10 minutes.
Treat a frozen section as a wall of ice instead.
In either instance, do not divide damage by four, as is normal for objects.
Control water can open and hold open a breach in a wall of water, so long as that spell can affect enough of the wall.
A wall of water can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Arcane Material Component: A vial of water.
