You conjure a tremendously powerful creature known as an elemental monolith (see page 156).
It appears at the spot you designate and acts immediately on your turn, attacking your opponents to the best of its ability.
If you speak the elemental monolith's language and are close enough to communicate with it, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
The monolith can't be summoned into an environment hostile to it in any way (for example, you couldn't summon a fire monolith underwater or an earth monolith high in mid-air).
When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.
Arcane Material Component: A gem worth 100 gp ï¿½ ;
aquamarine for air, tourmaline for earth, garnet for fire, or pearl for water.
