This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, transforming it into a glowing missile that destabilizes other forms of magic.
In addition to dealing normal damage, a spellslayer arrow deals an extra 1d4 points of damage for each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target.
For example, an arrow would deal an extra 3d4 points of damage to a creature under the effects of bull's strength,
haste, and mage armor.
The arrow or bolt must be fired during the same round the spell is cast, or the magic dissipates and is lost.
The projectile is destroyed even if it misses its target.
Material Component:Masterwork arrow or bolt.
