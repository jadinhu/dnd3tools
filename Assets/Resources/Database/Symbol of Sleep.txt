This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the symbol of sleep instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6x;10 minutes.
Unlike with the sleep spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.
Unlike symbol of death, symbol of sleep has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of sleep simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
Note:Magic traps such as symbol of sleep are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of sleep and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of sleep.
Material Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp.
