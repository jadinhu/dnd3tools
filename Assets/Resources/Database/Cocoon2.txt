<b>The silkworm cocoon disappears from your palm, and silk threads coalesce from thin air around your target, quickly wrapping about the body until it is fully encased.</b>
	
When cast upon a deceased creature (whose death can be no less recent than 1 round per caster level), this spell preserves the body and begins a slow process of rebirth. If the corpse is <b>raised</b>, 
<b>resurrected</b>, or <b>reincarnated</b> at any point during the next week, the creature takes no level loss or Constitution loss normally associated with such spells.
	
At the conclusion of the week, if the subject has not been returned to life, the creature is automatically <b>reincarnated</b>, as the spell, with no loss of level or Constitution.
