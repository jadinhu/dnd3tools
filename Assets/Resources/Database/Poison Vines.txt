<b>Poison Vines</b>(Complete Divine)

Conjuration (Creation)
 <b>Level:</b>  Druid 7,    
<b>Components:</b>
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates; see text
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes

 	
With this spell you create a mass of entangling vines. The spell otherwise works as the <b>entangle</b> spell, but the entangling plants are poisonous (contact, 1d6 Dex/2d6 Dex). A successful Fortitude save is required only upon the first entry into the spell's area (and again 1 minute later); creatures don't have to save each time they enter (or each round they remain within). You are immune to the poison of the vines you create, and you can select a number of other targets equal to your level to share this immunity.
