A chorus of glorious voices takes up your song.
This spell continues any one bardic music effect you are currently maintaining or on which you are concentrating.
It functions only on bardic music effects that can be maintained for longer than 1 round.
This allows you to cast spells, make use of a second bardic music ability, or otherwise concentrate on other matters.
You can cast lingering chorus even while maintaining a bardic music effect.
If you cast a second lingering chorus while the first is still in effect, the duration of the first spell ends.
