Shimmering, white, holy energy surrounds you.
This power has three effects:
1. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by Shadowlands creatures and creatures with a Taint score.
2. On making a successful melee touch attack against an oni or another outsider or elemental with the Shadowlands subtype, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane.
The creature negates the effects with a Will save (SR applies).
This use discharges and ends the spell.
3. With a touch, you can automatically dispel any one spell cast by a Tainted creature or any one maho spell.
Exception: Spells that can't be dispelled by dispel magic also can't be dispelled by dispel Taint.
Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect.
This use discharges and ends the spell.
