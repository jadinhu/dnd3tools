This spell is popular with Thayan slave overseers and those
wishing to make their servants work a little faster, but the Red Wizards mainly employ it as a combat spell.
The subject suffers agonizing pain for the duration of the spell unless he succeeds on a Fortitude save.
If the subject fails his saving throw, he is dazed for 1 round, and takes a -2 penalty on all attacks, saving throws, and checks while the spell lasts.
Nybor's gentle reminder distracts spellcasters, who must make Concentration checks to cast spells while under its effect (see the Concentration skill description in the Player's Handbook).
Focus: A slender wooden rod at least 1 foot long.
Note: This spell first appeared in Magic of FaerÃ»n.
This version supersedes the one originally printed there.
