You can affect existing shadows, both natural and magical, by causing them to deepen, lighten, or even move.
You can cause one of the following effects at a time, and can switch them once per round as a free action for the duration of the spell.
The chosen effect covers the entire area of the spell; multiple effects may not be applied to different areas.
The possible effects are described below.
Deepen Darkness and Shadow:Normal shadows now grant a +4 bonus on Hide checks and provide concealment to creatures within them.
Magical darkness now confers total concealment to anyone
within its area.
Lighten Darkness and Shadow:Normal shadows are suppressed within the area, making it impossible to hide within them or use abilities such as the shadowdancer's shadow jump ability.
Magical darkness no longer provides concealment, and the
area can now be illuminated by any light source.
Move Shadow: The affected shadow moves as you direct within the area.
You can create shadow illusions (as those created by a silent image spell, but without color), reveal hidden creatures by
taking their shadow away, cause shadows to follow you within the area of the spell, or otherwise move the shadow as you see fit.
You cannot move areas of darkness in this way.
