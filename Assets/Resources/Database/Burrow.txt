Your hands sprout claws as hard as stone.
You can use these claws to burrow through earth, sand, clay, and gravel (but not solid rock), excavating with enough speed to move through the earth at a speed of 10 feet, much like a badger.
You can use the claws as weapons that deal 1d6 points of damage.
If your normal unarmed damage is greater than 1d6, the damage does not change.
You are considered armed while this spell is in effect.
Arcane Material Component: A tuft of fur from a burrowing animal, and a tiny replica of a shovel.
