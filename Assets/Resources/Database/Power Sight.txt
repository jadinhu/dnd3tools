You determine the number of Hit Dice (including those from class levels) a creature currently has. If the creature has both monster Hit Dice and class levels, power sight reveals only the total. You cannot determine what class levels a creature has, and negative levels do not count against its HD. For example, both a 10-HD creature and a 10th-level character with 4 negative levels appear as 10-HD creatures.
