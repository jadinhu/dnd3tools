Portal alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size passes through the magic portal the spell is cast upon.
You decide at the time of casting whether the portal alarm will be mental or audible.
Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) as long as you remain within one mile of the warded area and on the same plane.
You notice a mental tremor that would awaken you from a normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration (it would not interfere with spellcasting).
A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.
Audible Alarm: An audible portal alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, buzzer, or other similar repeating sound that can be heard quite clearly up to 60 feet away, and it pierces closed doors and extends onto other planes.
The ringing may be heard faintly up to 180 feet away and lasts for 1 round.
Creatures within the area of a silence spell cannot hear the ringing, and if the portal itself is within the area of a silence spell, no alarm is sounded.
Ethereal and astral creatures trigger the portal alarm if they pass through the portal.
You may set the portal alarm with a password, determined at the time of the casting, and this password may be discerned with the analyze portal spell.
Those speaking the password before passing through the portal do not set off the alarm.
Material Component: A tiny bell.
