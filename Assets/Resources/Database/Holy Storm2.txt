<b>You call upon the forces of good, and a heavy rain begins to fall around you, its raindrops soft and warm.</b>
	
A driving rain falls around you. It falls in a fixed area once created. The storm reduces hearing and visibility, resulting in a -4 penalty on Listen, Spot, and Search checks. It also applies a -4 penalty on ranged attacks made into, out of, or through the storm. Finally, it automatically extinguishes any unprotected flames and has a 50% chance to extinguish protected flames (such as those of lanterns).
	
The rain damages evil creatures, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round (evil outsiders take double damage) at the beginning of your turn.
	
Material Component: A flask of holy water (25 gp).
