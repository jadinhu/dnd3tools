Harmonic chorus lets you improve the spellcasting ability of another spellcaster.
For the duration of the spell, the save DCs for all spells that the subject casts increase by 1d4+1.
If such a spell deals damage, that damage increases by +1 point per die.
For example, if you cast harmonic chorus on a 9th-level wizard who in turn casts fireball, the DC of the fireball's Reflex save would increase by 1d4+1, and the spell would deal 9d6+9 points of fire damage.
Other variable aspects of the spell (range, duration, and so forth) remain unchanged.
The benefits of multiple harmonic chorus spells stack only when they are cast by different casters.
Material Component: A tuning fork.
