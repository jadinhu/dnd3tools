This spell grants the Blindsight feat.
The target creature gains sensitivity to vibrations, so that it maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature.
The target creature's senses extend to a 30-foot radius, and the creature need not make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within this range.
Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though the creature can't discern ethereal beings.
