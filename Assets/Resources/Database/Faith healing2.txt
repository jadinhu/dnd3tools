When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (up to +5). The spell works only on a creature that worships the same deity as you. A target with no deity or a different deity from yours is unaffected by the spell, even if the target would normally be harmed by positive energy.
