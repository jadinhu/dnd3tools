You utter shrieks of nonsense and gibberish that thinking creatures find distracting and confusing.
The spell affects only creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher.
Any such creatures within the spell's area must succeed on Fortitude saves or be stunned for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores of 20 or higher), dazed for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores between 10 and 19), or shaken for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores between 3 and 9).
In addition, a creature within the spell's area loses any psionic focus it might have had and takes a -4 penalty on Concentration checks for 1 round.
These effects happen whether or not the creature succeeded on its save.
