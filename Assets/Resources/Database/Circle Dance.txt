You divine the relative direction and condition of another individual.
During the casting of the spell, you think of your target as you do a spinning dance around the compass.
You must have firsthand knowledge of your target for the spell to function.
If the target is alive and on the same plane as you, the spell leaves you facing in the direction of your target.
You also get an impression of the target's physical and emotional conditions (unharmed, wounded, unconscious, dying, and so on).
If the target is on a different plane or dead, you feel nothing.
