<b>Components:</b>
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action

 <b>Target:</b> One creature

<b>A faint nimbus of sickly gray shadow surrounds your weapon. When you attack, this shadowy aura flows into the wound you inflict, sapping your opponent?s strength, vitality, and energy.</b>
	
As part of this maneuver, make a single melee attack. If this attack hits, you deal normal melee damage and the target must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 12 + your Wis modifier) or take 2 points of Constitution damage. A successful save negates the Constitution damage but not the normal melee damage.</p
