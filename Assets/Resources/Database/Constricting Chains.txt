You call upon the heavenly powers to bind a creature in writhing chains of scintillating light.
The creature is entangled, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity.
Moreover, the chains are anchored to the nearest immobile object (usually the floor), preventing the bound creature from moving.
An entangled creature attempting to cast a spell must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell.
The chains automatically constrict the bound creature for 3d6 points of nonlethal damage per round unless the caster (as a free action) commands the chains not to deal damage during any given round.
The constricting chains have AC 20, 5 hp per caster level (maximum 100 hp), and damage reduction 10/magic.
They are immune to energy-based attacks, nonlethal damage, and all spells except dispel magic and similar effects.
They are not subject to critical hits.
Half of all damage dealt to the chains (rounded down) is transferred to the target.
A successful DC 32 Strength check breaks the chains and ends the spell.
An entangled creature can also attempt to escape (requiring 1 minute) with a DC 40 Escape Artist check.
Focus: A small silver chain (10 gp).
Sacrifice: 1d2 points of Strength drain.
