A blazing crown of golden light surrounds your head.
Creatures you engage in melee combat must make successful Fortitude saving throws or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
Creatures that successfully save, and creatures that have recovered from blindness, are still dazzled for as long as they remain in melee with you.
Creatures with light sensitivity and creatures that are harmed by sunlight (such as vampires) must make a Will save if they are within the area of the spell.
Creatures that fail their saving throws must move outside the area.
Undead within the area take 1d6 points of damage each round they remain in the area.
Material Component: An opal worth at least 100 gp, carried on your person through the duration of the spell.
The opal shatters upon completion of the spell, and the spell ends prematurely if the opal is shattered by other means.
