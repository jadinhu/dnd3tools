Rather than creating an illusion of something, this spell creates an illusion of absolute nothingness. The spell effect surrounds the subject in a dark, clinging shadow that only it perceives, which blocks all auditory, olfactory, taste, and visual sensations. In addition, it blocks finely tuned senses of touch such as those that provide a creature with tremorsense. A subject that fails its save is blinded and deafened, and it gains no benefit from blindsense, blindsight, scent, or tremorsense.
	
The subject retains any telepathic or empathic links it might possess with other creatures while affected by the spell.
	
Material Component: Black silk cloth tied like a blindfold.
