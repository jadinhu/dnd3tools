You can cause temporary lycanthropy in a humanoid you touch.
A humanoid who fails the saving throw contracts lycanthropy, and the condition manifests with the next full moon.
Unlike other forms of lycanthropy, the effect of this spell can be broken by remove curse or break enchantment.
You can induce any type of common lycanthropy (and evil clerics frequently experiment with new kinds).
As a rule, the lycanthrope's animal form can be any predator between the size of a small dog and a large bear.
The source of the material component determines the victim's animal form.
(More information on lycanthropes can be found in Appendix 3 of the Monster Manual).
Material Component: A pint of animal blood.
