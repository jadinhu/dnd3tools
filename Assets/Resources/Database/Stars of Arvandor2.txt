You create one twinkling star per level (maximum ten stars).
These minute starbursts orbit your head like ioun stones.
As a swift action, you can launch one star at a target you designate within range.
Alternatively, as a standard action, you can launch up to three stars at one or more targets within range.
You can only launch stars once per round.
You must make a ranged touch attack for each star.
Against non-evil targets, each star deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage; evil targets take 1d8 points of lethal damage instead.
