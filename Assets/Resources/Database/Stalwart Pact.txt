This spell allows the target to enter a binding agreement with a deity that provides a measure of protection when the need is dire.
Once this spell is cast, the pact remains dormant until the target is reduced to half or less of her full normal hit points.
The target immediately gains 5 temporary hit points per caster level, damage reduction of 5/magic, and a +4 luck bonus on saving throws.
The hit points, damage reduction, and saving throw bonus evaporate when the spell ends.
XP Cost: 250 XP.
