<b>You draw strength from the earth beneath your feet and transfer it into ruinous power. Your next attack drops like an avalanche upon your foe, hammering him into submission.</b>
	
The students of the Stone Dragon discipline learn to tap into the power of the earth, channel its endless strength, and use it to grant their attacks tremendous force. A strike delivered by a Stone Dragon adept can shatter a warrior?s shield, turn a wooden door into splinters, or slay an ogre with a single blow.
	
When you use this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. That attack deals an extra 6d6 points of damage and automatically overcomes damage reduction and hardness.</p
