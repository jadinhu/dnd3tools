You surround the subject with an aura that immediately heals her if she suffers an attack that would kill her (reduce her hit points to -10 or below).
When this event occurs, the fortunate fate spell intervenes by immediately triggering a heal spell upon the target.
If the attack is one that causes harm in a way that a heal spell can repair (disease, hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or poison), the target does not actually die, saved by the heal.
If the attack is one that heal cannot countermand (such as ability drain, old age, negative levels, disintegration, ability drain, or death effects), the fortunate fate spell cannot prevent her death.
If this spell is cast upon an undead creature, it uses a harm spell instead of heal.
