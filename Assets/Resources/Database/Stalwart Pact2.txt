This spell allows the target to enter a binding agreement with a deity, who provides a measure of protection when the need is dire.
Once this spell is cast, the pact remains dormant until the target is reduced to fewer than half of her full normal hit points.
The target immediately gains 5 temporary hit points per caster level, damage reduction 5/magic, and a +4 luck bonus on saving throws.
The hit points, damage reduction, and saving throw bonus disappear when the spell ends.
XP Cost: 250 XP.
