You conjure into existence a quarterstaff of force, approximately 8 feet long and 2 inches in diameter.
The decastave lasts only so long as you keep it in hand; if you give it to another character or drop it, it vanishes.
(You can cast other spells with somatic components by holding the staff in one hand).
You can use the decastave in combat to strike with a melee touch attack, dealing 1d6 points of damage per hit.
Since the decastave is made of force, it affects incorporeal and ethereal creatures normally (provided you can see such creatures).
The decastave possesses the thundering weapon ability and deals 1d8 points of bonus sonic damage on a critical hit.
Subjects dealt a critical hit by the decastave must also succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be deafened permanently.
Material Component: A slender wand of duskwood (this material is described in Chapter 6: Magic Items of Magic of FaerÃ»n).
