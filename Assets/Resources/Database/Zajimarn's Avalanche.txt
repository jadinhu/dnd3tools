You conjure a sweeping wave of ice, snow, and slush that washes away everything it its path.
Everything in the initial area of the spell takes 1d4 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d4).
Creatures on foot and objects in the initial area must make Reflex saves or be carried along by the wave for 5 feet per caster level.
The forced movement does not harm the targets except to leave them prone.
Dead-end corridors and similar obstacles prevent the avalanche from moving creatures any farther.
The avalanche counts as a water attack for the purpose of extinguishing normal fires.
