No sooner has the blast of fire burst forth from your hands than you feel it building within you again.
This spell deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures in the area.
If you cast incendiary surge again before the end of your next turn, the second casting deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), and you gain a +2 bonus on any caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance with that casting of the spell.
