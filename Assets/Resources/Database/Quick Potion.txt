<b>You mutter the last of the spell's words and wave your fingers over the flask. Coppery sparks drop from your fingertips and suffuse the water with a deep rusty shade. As the sparks dissolve fully, you begin casting your next spell.</b>
	
You transform the water in a flask so that it is capable of storing a spell in the manner of a potion. On your next turn, you or another spellcaster can cast a spell into the water, transforming the water into a potion of the appropriate type. Only spells suitable for making potions can be used in this way.
