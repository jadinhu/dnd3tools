You are imbued with an aura of celestial authority, inspiring awe in all lesser creatures that behold your terrible perfection and righteousness.
You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your Charisma score for the duration of the spell.
All creatures with fewer than 8 HD or levels cease whatever they are doing and are compelled to pay attention to you.
Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against you must make a successful Will save to do so.
Any creature that does not make this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action is enthralled for the
duration of the spell (as the enthrall spell), as long as it is in the spell's area, nor will it try to leave the area on its own.
Creatures with 8 HD or more may pay attention to you, but are not affected by this spell.
When you speak, all listeners telepathically understand you, even if they do not understand your language.
While the spell lasts, you can make up to three suggestions to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the mass suggestion spell (Will save negates); creatures with 8 HD ormore aren't affected by this power.
Only creatures within range at the time a suggestion is given are subject to it.
Material Component: An opal worth at least 200 gp.
