This spell has two possible effects: Divine Fortitude: The target becomes immune to subdual damage, charm effects, compulsions, and attacks that function by causing pain, and is immune to effects that would cause her to be dazed, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, staggered, or stunned.
The target remains conscious at -1 to -9 hit points and can take a partial action each round when in that state.
If any of these effects are present on the target when this spell is cast, they are suspended for the duration (causing the target to wake if unconscious).
This variant of the spell lasts 1 minute/level.
When the spell ends, any effects suspended by the spell that would otherwise still be in effect (such as fatigue, which normally requires 8 hours of rest to abate) return.
Effects with durations that expired during the duration of this spell do not resume when this spell ends.
Pact of Martyrdom: You and the target exchange hit point totals.
This variant of the spell only works if you have more hit points than the target when the spell is cast.
If the target was unconscious and dying, you become unconscious and dying.
If the target was unconscious but stabilized, you become unconscious but stabilized.
The spell only transfers actual hit points, not temporary hit points.
Clerics and paladins who don't worship Ilmater name this spell after their own deity � ;favor of Torm, for example.
