You point at the target of this spell.
The colors of your clothing, skin, and hair shine for a brief moment before they surge away from you, forming a multicolored ray that strikes your target.
You disappear as the colors of your body and items leap from you into the beam.
The target clutches his eyes and staggers.
You strip the color from your body and gear, turn it into a lance of energy, and hurl it at a target.
When you cast this spell, you target a creature with the colors stripped from your form.
The target must make a Will save or be blinded for 1 round.
You also gain the benefit of invisibility, for the duration of this spell, even if the target creature succeeds on its save or if its spell resistance protects it.
Focus: A small prism.
