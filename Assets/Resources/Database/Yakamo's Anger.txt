This spell unleashes the anger of the sun deity in a blinding flash originating with you and expanding outward.
Any creature within the area of the spell that can see you must make a saving throw or be temporarily blinded.
The blindness lasts for 1 minute per caster level.
In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a <del>4 penalty on Search checks and most Strength</del> and Dexterity-based skill checks.
Sightless creatures are not affected by Yakamo's anger.
