This spell functions like jump, except that it affects a group of creatures in an area, all of which gain a +10 enhancement bonus on Jump checks.
The enhancement bonus increases to +20 at caster level 10th, and to +30 (the maximum) at caster level 14th.
Pirates on the Great Sea are fond of this spell during boarding actions.
