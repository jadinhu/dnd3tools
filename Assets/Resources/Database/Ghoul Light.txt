A sickly green flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch.
The effect looks like a regular flame, except for its green hue, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen.
Ghoul light can be covered and hidden, but not smothered or quenched.
All undead within 30 feet of a source of ghoul light gain +1 turn resistance.
Multiple ghoul light sources do not stack.
Darkness spells of 2nd level or lower can counter ghoul light.
