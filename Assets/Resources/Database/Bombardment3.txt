<b>Bombardment</b>(Spell Compendium, p. 37)

Conjuration (Creation)
 <b>Level:</b>  Druid 8,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, AF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 Standard Action
 <b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
 <b>Area:</b> Cylinder (15-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)
 <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half; See text
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> No

 	
<b>You point to the empty air and boulders tumble into being, burying your opponents.</b>
	
You designate the spot on which the cylinder is centered. Each creature in the area that fails a Reflex saving throw takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8) and is buried under 5 feet of rubble. A successful save halves the damage and avoids burial. A buried creature can free itself with a DC 20 Strength check (a full-round action), or it can be dug free by others (a single creature working alone requires 1 minute to free a trapped creature). A buried creature is unable to move, and cannot cast spells with somatic components, and any material components must be in hand.
	
After this spell is cast, its area is
covered in 5 feet of dense rubble
(<b>DMG</b> 90).
	
<b>Focus:</b> A quartz crystal embedded in rock.
