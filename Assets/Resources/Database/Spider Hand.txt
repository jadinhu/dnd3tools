 <b>Level:</b>  Cleric 1,  Druid 1,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action
 <b>Range:</b> Personal
 <b>Target:</b> Caster's hand
 <b>Duration:</b> Concentration (up to 1 minute/level)

 	
The caster detaches his hand, which transforms into a Small monstrous spider (see the Monster Manual) that he controls.
The caster can see through its eyes, and it can travel up to 20 feet per level away from him.
If the spider is killed or prevented from returning to the caster, his hand is restored when the spell ends, but he takes 1d6 points of damage.
If the caster directs the spider to return to his arm (a move-equivalent action), then lets the spell end, he takes no damage.
