On your successful melee touch attack, a target that fails its saving throw is subject to being swallowed whole.
To the observer, it appears as if your maw suddenly opens many times its normal size, after which the victim is engulfed.
Your maw immediately returns to its natural size.
Of the victim, there is no visible sign ï¿½ ;the swallowed subject exists in a temporary &quot;stomach&quot; dimension.
The swallowed victim takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus 12 points of acid damage per round while in the stomach dimension.
A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the stomach dimension (AC 21).
A creature that successfully exits appears to cut its way free from thin air, appearing in a space adjacent to the caster.
Each time you cast this spell, you create a separate temporary stomach dimension.
