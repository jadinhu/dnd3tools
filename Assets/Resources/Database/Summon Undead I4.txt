As summon monster I, except that you summon an undead creature.
The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the Summon Undead table below.
You choose which creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.
Summoned undead do not count toward your total Hit Dice of undead you can control with animate dead or clerical negative energy.
When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
Focus: A tiny bag, a small (not lit) candle, and a carved bone from any humanoid.
