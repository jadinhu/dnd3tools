The targeted weapon shudders and momentarily emits a moaning chorus, like that of damned souls.
This spell places an infernal blessing on the touched weapon for the specified duration.
Upon casting the spell, you must name or describe a specific creature.
If that creature is subsequently reduced to ï¿½ ;10 or fewer hit points by a blow from the target weapon before the spell's duration expires, its soul is whisked immediately to the Hall of the Vanquished in Stygia, where it remains forever, or until rescued.
A weapon can gain the effect of only one bind to Hell spell at a time.
The soul manifests as a frozen version of its mortal self.
With the utterance of a trigger word chosen by you upon casting, it can be temporarily imbued with motion and the use of its faculties.
A subsequent utterance of the trigger word freezes the soul again.
While the soul is in the Hall of the Vanquished, life-restoring spells and effects, such as raise dead, reincarnation,
and resurrection, cannot be used to revive the creature.
If the soul form of a nonoutsider is removed from the hall, it transmigrates immediately to its proper afterlife, after which life-restoring effects again become possible.
Special:Only divine casters who worship Levistus can cast this spell.
It has no effect for any other caster.
