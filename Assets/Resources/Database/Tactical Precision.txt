When you cast this spell, you grant your allies greater insight into one another's actions, allowing them to better coordinate their attacks.
If two affected allies flank the same creature, each gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against the flanked creature.
This bonus is in addition to the normal +2 bonus on attack rolls granted to flanking creatures.
In addition, if an affected ally successfully deals damage against an opponent that is flanked by another affected ally, she deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.
Creatures immune to sneak attacks are immune to this extra damage.
Material Component: A toy soldier.
