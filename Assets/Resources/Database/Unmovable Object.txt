Charging yourself with divine energy, you bond yourself to the ground beneath your feet and become the epitome of stability.
The spell ends instantly if you move from your current position and does not work unless you are in contact with the ground.
You gain a +2 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.
You gain a +10 bonus to resist a bull rush (this bonus does not include the +4 bonus for being &quot;exceptionally stable&quot;, but exceptionally stable creatures do get that bonus in addition to the bonus from this spell).
You gain a +10 bonus to resist all trip attacks (but not to your attempts to trip someone in return).
You gain a +10 resistance bonus on any roll made to resist an effect that would cause you to move from your current location.
For example, while you are not immune to enchantment effects, you gain a +10 resistance bonus on saving throws (or Charisma checks, in the case of effects such as charm person) to resist commands that would cause you to leave your current position.
If the ground you stand on disappears or cannot support your weight (such as with disintegrate or transmute rock to mud), this spell ends and the existing conditions affect you normally.
