The cerulean sign is an ancient symbol said to embody the purity of the natural world, and as such it is anathema to aberrations.
While druids and rangers are the classes most often known to cast this ancient spell, its magic is nearly universal and can be mastered by all spellcasting classes.
When you cast this spell, you trace the cerulean sign in the air with a hand, leaving a glowing blue rune in the air for a
brief moment before it flashes and fills the area of effect with a pulse of cerulean light.
Any aberration within the area must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the following ill effects.
Closer aberrations are affected first.
Each effect lasts for 1 round.
None: The aberration suffers no ill effect, even if it fails the
saving throw.
Sickened: The aberration takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round.
Nauseated: The aberration cannot attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything but take a single move action for 1 round.
Dazed: The aberration can take no actions, but has no penalty to its Armor Class, for 1 round.
Stunned: The aberration drops everything held, can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round.
Once a creature recovers from an effect, it moves up one level on the table.
Thus, a creature that is stunned by this spell is dazed the round after that, nauseated the round after that, sickened the round after that, and then recovers fully the next round.
