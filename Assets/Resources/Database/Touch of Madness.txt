You may daze one living creature by making a successful touch attack.
If the target creature does not make a successful Will save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for 1 round per caster level.
A dazed creature is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.
