You give a weapon the undead bane property in addition to any other properties it has.
Against undead, your weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) is +2 higher than normal and it deals +2d6 points of bonus damage against undead.
The spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon that already has the undead bane property.
At caster level 9 (paladin level 18) and above, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus if it is not already a magic weapon.
Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets.
The projectiles must be of the same type, and they have to be together, such as in the same quiver.
Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their transmutation after they have been fired.
The weapon is considered blessed, which means it has special effects on certain creatures.
Any weapon affected by this spell glows with a serene gray radiance that sheds as much light as a candle.
