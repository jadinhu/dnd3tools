You conjure a quasi-real, staglike creature.
The creature can either be directed to attack a target or simply carry you on its back.
When you cast the spell, you decide if you want the stag to appear next to you or form underneath you so you may ride it immediately.
The stag has a speed of 60 feet and can act as soon as it appears.
It moves as you direct.
Controlling the stag is a free action.
The stag can ride in the air as if it were firm land, as a phantom steed spell cast by a 12th-level caster.
It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
The mount has an Armor Class of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level.
If it loses all its hit points, the spectral stag disappears.
If directed to attack a creature, the stag charges its target and initiates a bull rush.
The stag is Large and has Strength 18 for this purpose.
The stag cannot be attacked or damaged, but if you are riding it when it attempts a bull rush, the defender may use her attack of opportunity against you instead of against the stag.
If the bull rush fails, the stag (and you, if riding it)moves 5 feet straight back to where it was before it moved into the target's space.
If the bull rush succeeds, the stag moves the defender the maximum distance possible.
The defender also must make a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.
When the spell ends, the stag vanishes.
If you were riding the stag, you land safely on the ground.
