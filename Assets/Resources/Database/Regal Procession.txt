<b>You toss a bit of horsehair into the air, and as it drifts toward the ground, an array of finely adorned mounts appears.</b>
	
This spell functions like <b>mount</b> (PH 256), except you can summon several mounts. Each comes with a bit and bridle, riding saddle, saddle blanket, ribbons, adornments, and a banner. You select the colors of the horses and the livery, either or both of which can include a heraldic or personal symbol.
