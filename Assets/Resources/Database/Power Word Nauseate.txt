You speak a word of power so disgusting that your target retches. You utter a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of your choice to become nauseated, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total, as shown below. Any creature that currently has 151 or more hit points is unaffected by <b>power word nauseate</b>.
