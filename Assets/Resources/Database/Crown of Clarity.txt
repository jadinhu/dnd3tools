A crown of magical energy appears upon your head.
For a moment, your vision blurs and a slight buzz fills your ears.
These distractions pass, leaving you with sharpened senses.
You create an arcane crown that grants the wearer a +2 competence bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
As an immediate action, the creature wearing a crown of clarity can discharge its magic to gain a +8 bonus on a single Spot or Listen check.
The spell ends after the wearer uses the crown in this manner.
The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm.
If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.
Focus: A pewter hoop 6 inches in diameter.
