For the duration of this spell, the caster's teleport or teleport without error spell-like ability is quickened.
This means that the caster can teleport as a free action and still have time during the round to attack and/or move.
The caster can use his quickened teleport or teleport without error once per round.
This spell does not affect teleport spells in any way, only the spell-like ability of fiends to teleport themselves.
