This spell conjures thick, stony arms that spring forth from a rock or stone formation whenever anyone passes near it.
Each 10-foot square in the spell's area contains one stone
arm.
The arms attempt to grapple any creature that enters their area.
Each arm has a Strength of 20 and a base attack bonus of +1/caster level (plus Strength bonus).
The arms are Medium-size.
Once an arm has grappled a target, it automatically inflicts 1d6+5 points of damage per round.
An arm maintains its grapple until the subject escapes, even holding a victim long after death.
Each arm has 1 hp/caster level, AC 18, and hardness 8, and saves as the caster.
Before they attack, the arms remain beneath the surface of the stone.
They may be discovered (but not disarmed) as a magic trap.
