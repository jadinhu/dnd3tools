You cause a flicker of magic to momentarily exist in a place where magic cannot normally function, such as within the area of an antimagic field, a dead magic area, or a null-magic plane.
This allows you the ability to cast a single spell of 4th level or lower, which then ends the spell's effect.
Casting invoke magic is a swift action, like casting a quickened spell.
You can perform only one swift action each round.
Normally, you cast invoke magic and then immediately follow it by casting another spell as a standard action.
Material Component: A diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.
