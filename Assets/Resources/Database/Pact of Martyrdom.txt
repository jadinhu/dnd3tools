You exchange hit point totals with a target that has fewer hit points than you do.
If the target was unconscious and dying, you become unconscious and dying.
If the target was unconscious but stabilized, you become unconscious but stabilized.
The spell transfers only actual hit points, not temporary hit points.
Pact of martyrdom does not function if you have fewer hit points than the target when you cast the spell.
