You enchant a creature so that it feels suddenly compelled to give you what it is holding when you cast this spell.
On the creature's next action, it moves as close to you as it can get in a single round and offers you the object as a standard action.
This spell allows you to act out of turn and accept the &quot;gift&quot;
if the creature reaches you to hand you the object (assuming you have a free hand and can accept it).
The subject defends itself normally and acts as it wishes on subsequent rounds, including attempting to get the object back if desired.
If the subject is prevented from doing as the spell compels, the spell is wasted.
For example, if the subject is paralyzed and cannot move or drop the item, nothing happens.
