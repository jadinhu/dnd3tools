<b>You cast this spell, and you picture a forge in your mind. You think of the forge as you cast your next spell, but that spell does not manifest. Instead, your hands glow with a golden curative radiance.</b>
	
You channel the spell energy from a spell you know into healing magic. After you cast this spell, the next spell you cast in the same round is converted to positive energy. When you cast the second spell, you touch yourself or another creature, curing 1d8 points of damage for every spell level of the spell you cast. If the spell you cast was prepared with a metamagic feat, you use the level of the spell slot the spell occupied.
