The caster can control one chain per level as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as she wishes.
In addition, the caster can increase the chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs.
These chains attack as spiked chains that use the caster's normal ranged attack bonus on attack rolls or grapple checks (treat each chain as Medium-size when grappling).
The caster can climb a chain she controls at normal speed without making a Climb check.
