This spell allows the target to enter into a binding agreement with your deity that brings the target back to life if she is slain.
When this spell is cast, the target's Constitution is permanently lowered by 2 points.
In exchange for this, if she ever dies, several spells are brought into effect.
First, she is teleported to a safe location designated by you at the time of casting as if with a word of recall spell.
Second, the target is brought back from the dead with a raise dead spell with the standard loss of a level.
Finally, the target is healed with a heal spell.
She does not regain the 2 Constitution points when returned to life.
If a raise dead spell could not return the target to life (for example, if she was disintegrated or died of old age), the death pact cannot restore her to life.
If the spell is dispelled before the target dies, she does not regain her 2 lost Constitution points.
Material Component: A diamond worth at least 500 gp.
XP cost: 250 XP.
