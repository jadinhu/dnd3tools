This spell functions like symbol of death (see page 289 of the Player's Handbook), except that all creatures within 60 feet of a symbol of thirst are consumed by a terrible sense of thirst (as the tormenting thirst spell; see below) for 10 minutes per caster level.
Note:Magic traps, such as symbol of thirst, are hard to detect and disable.
A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of thirst and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for symbol of thirst.
Material Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.
