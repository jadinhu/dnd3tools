This spell evaluates the creatures in the area and determines the relative power level of each.
Creatures are evaluated as follows:
Among creatures within the same category, you know which is the most powerful, but not why.
For example, among a group of ogres (CR 2), you would know one of them (an ogre with 2 levels of barbarian, CR 4) was the most powerful, but not know if it was because the ogre had class levels, because of a template (such as half-fiendish), or for other reasons.
Any spell of 3rd level or higher that prevents scrying attempts on a creature (such as nondetection) or area (such as false vision) thwarts this spell's ability to evaluate that creature or creatures within that area.
