<b>Components:</b>

 	
Your body inflates grotesquely as eight enormous spider legs burst through your flesh.
As the transformation finishes, your skin hardens into a dark exoskeleton.
As lesser spider form, except you take on the form and abilities of a Huge fiendish monstrous spider (MM 289).
You are treated as having the spider's Hit Dice (8) for the purpose of adjudicating the special abilities gained from the fiendish template.
