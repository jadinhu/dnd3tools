<b>You cast a silver bar in the direction of the portal and it vanishes, becoming a semi-translucent net of silver magic that briefly encases the portal before disappearing.</b>
	
You can permanently seal an interplanar gate or portal. The spell prevents any use of the portal, although seal portal can be dispelled by a dispel magic spell. A knock spell does not function on a sealed portal, but a chime of opening dispels seal portal if seal portal was cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level.
	
Once a portal is opened, seal portal does not remain in effect and must be cast again.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A silver bar worth 50 gp.
