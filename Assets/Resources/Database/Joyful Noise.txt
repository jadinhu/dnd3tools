You create sonic vibrations that negate any magical silence effect in the area.
This zone of negation moves with you and lasts as long as you continue to concentrate.
The silence is not dispelled but simply held in abeyance; it remains in effect outside the area of the joyful noise effect.
Thus, this spell is usually used to move a group out of range of a silence effect.
