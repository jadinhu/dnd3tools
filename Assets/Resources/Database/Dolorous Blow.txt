<b>A longing for battle fills you as you complete this spell. Upon touching the intended weapon, the feeling fades even as a dull red aura encompasses the weapon.</b>
	
For the duration of the spell, the weapon's threat range is doubled, and its critical threats automatically confirm, so every threat is a critical hit. The latter effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits.
	
Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as this spell and the Improved Critical feat) don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.
