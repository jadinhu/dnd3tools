A violent burst of sand and howling wind streams forth from your hand, extending outward in a cone.
Every creature and object within the cone takes 6d8 points of damage and is subjected to winds of hurricane force that blow directly away from you.
These winds blow away Medium or smaller creatures, knock down Large creatures, and check Huge or larger creatures.
(See Table 3-24: Wind Effects, page 95 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Any creature that succeeds on a Fortitude save takes half damage from the sandblast and ignores the wind effect.
Material Component: A handful of sand from the heart of a desert.
