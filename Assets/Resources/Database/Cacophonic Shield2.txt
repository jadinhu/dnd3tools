You create an immobile barrier of sonic energy at a distance of 10 feet from yourself.
Creatures on either side of the barrier hear it as a loud but harmless buzzing.
Nonmagical sound (including sound produced by a thunderstone) does not cross the barrier.
If a sonic effect impinges upon the barrier, you get to make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of the effect to prevent it from affecting anyone inside the barrier.
A creature that crosses the barrier takes 1d6 points of sonic damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +20) and must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute.
The sonic vibrations provide a 20% miss chance for any missiles crossing the barrier in either direction.
