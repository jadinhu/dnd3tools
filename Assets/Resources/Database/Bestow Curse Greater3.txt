<b>Channeling your hatred into binding words of power, you thrust your hand at your foe and proclaim a terrible curse.</b>
	
The spellcaster places a curse on the creature touched, choosing one of the three following effects.			One ability score is reduced to 1, or two ability scores take � ;6 penalties (to a minimum score of 1).		 � ;8 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.		Each turn, the subject has a 25% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.	
	
You can also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above, and the Dungeon Master has the final say on the curse's effect. 
	
A greater curse cannot be dispelled,
nor can it can be removed with break enchantment or limited wish. A miracle or wish spell removes a greater curse, as does remove curse cast by a spellcaster of at least 17th level.
