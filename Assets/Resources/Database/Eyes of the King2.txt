<b>Letting a bit of bat fur loose to float on the air, you summon huge, glowing green bats to serve as your eyes.</b>
	
You summon four fiendish dire bats (<b>MM</b> 62) that blaze with a faint ghoul-green light (they glow as bright as a candle). These fiendish dire bats have damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance 9; and a smite good attack that provides a +4 bonus on one damage roll.
	
The bats allow you to see through their eyes, from their perspective, using your own visual senses. If you have darkvision, low-light vision, or spells cast that enhance your visual senses, such as <b>true seeing</b> or <b>see invisibility</b>, you continue to gain the benefit of those abilities or spells through the eyes of your bat minions. The bats also give you the benefit of their blindsense ability for the purpose of viewing their surroundings for the duration of the spell.
	
You can summon the bats at any point you can see, but they can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. Even while outside your line of sight, they follow your mental directions on where to explore. The dire bats travel together, never separating by more than 40 feet if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking a the floor) or at half speed (speed 20 feet) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The bats can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts.
	
You must concentrate to control the dire bats. If you do not concentrate, the bats move to attack the closes active creature. once concentration lapses, the spell ends 5 rounds later.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A bit of bat fur.
