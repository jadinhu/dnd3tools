You bring into being a mobile, spherical energy field that protects against cold.
All creatures within the area of the spell are granted immunity to cold.
In addition, the sphere prevents the entrance of any creature with the cold subtype.
The effect hedges out such creatures in the area when it is cast.
This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively.
Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier (see Abjuration, page 172 of the Player's Handbook).
