<b>With a single word and gesture, you send small, unattended objects flying about the room.</b>
	
You can point to a collection of little, unsecured items and cause them to fly off in all directions simultaneously. The spray of items creates a burst with a 10-foot radius. If the items are fairly hard or sharp (such as stones, sling bullets, coins, or the like), creatures in the burst take 1d8 points of damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage. Eggs, fruit, and other soft objects can be used, but the damage then dealt is nonlethal damage.
