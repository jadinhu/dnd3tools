You whisk yourself from place to place with a word.
For the duration of this spell, you gain the ability to teleport yourself up to 30 feet once per round as a move action.
You can bring along held or carried objects, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.
You can't transport other creatures except for a familiar.
You must be able to see your destination; if you attempt to teleport into a solid object, the action is wasted but the spell remains in effect.
If you don't end your teleport on a solid surface, you fall immediately.
