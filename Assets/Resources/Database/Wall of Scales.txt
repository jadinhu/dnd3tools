You blow a dragon scale from your palm, and before you sprouts a wall of glittering scales, pulsing like living flesh.
You create a barrier of living dragonhide that is anchored to the ground or floor, or between two vertical surfaces.
A wall of scales is 1 inch thick per two caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level.
You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
You can create a wall of scales in almost any shape you desire, provided it is anchored in some fashion.
It need not be vertical, and you can shape it into a circular or dome-shaped enclosure about yourself or another creature.
The wall can be destroyed by normal means of dealing damage, as well as by disintegrate spells and so forth.
It is immune to acid and fire.
In addition, the wall of scales has damage reduction 5/magic.
For every five caster levels above 5th, this damage reduction increases by 5, reaching a maximum of 20/magic at 20th level.
Each 5-foot square of wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness.
A section of wall whose hit points are reduced to 0 is breached.
It is not possible to break a wall of scales with a Strength check.
It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of scales, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.
Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.
Material Component: A pristine dragon scale.
