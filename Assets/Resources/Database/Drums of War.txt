When a bard casts drums of war and plays her instrument, the spell transforms that music into an ominous cadence of drumbeats that fills enemies with doubt.
All enemies within range of the spell take a -2 penalty on their attack rolls and saving throws as long as the drums of war continue and for an additional 1 round per level afterward.
Deaf enemies and enemies under the effect of a silence spell are unaffected by this spell.
Focus: A masterwork musical instrument, which must be played.
