With this spell, you create a cone of music that draws upon the sadness, guilt, and despair of those within its area of effect.
All creatures in the area take a -4 penalty on Listen checks for 1 round.
In addition, those who fail to save against love's lament are reminded of all their lost loves and disappointments in life.
The music seizes upon these feelings and magnifies them, so that the victims of the spell take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and are nauseated for 1d4 rounds.
