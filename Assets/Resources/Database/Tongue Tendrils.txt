The caster's tongue becomes a powerful tendril that she may spit up to 30 feet away.
This tendril wraps around a target, lashing it to something if possible.
The tendril makes a grapple attack using the caster's melee attack bonus, dealing no damage but starting a grapple as a Small creature with a Strength score of 20.
If the tendril wins the grapple check, it wraps around a limb or whatever is appropriate for the foe, lashing it to any nearby object.
Each tendril has AC 14, 10 hit points, and a break DC of 24.
The caster may create up to one such tendril for every four caster levels, spitting each one as a standard action.
At the end of the spell's duration, the tendrils become bloody bits of organic matter.
Material Component: A serpent's tongue.
