You use the raw power of your deity to reach into your target's soul and pull forth its sins, leaving their horror exposed for all to see.
You affect the target differently based on how its alignment compares to your own.
If the target's alignment is the same as yours, weight of sin has no effect.
If the target's alignment differs from yours but contains no directly opposing components (for example, the target is neutral good and you are lawful neutral), the spell deals 1
point of damage per caster level (maximum 15) and has no secondary effect.
If the target's alignment has one aspect opposed to yours (such as law/chaos), but not both, the spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4), and the subject suffers a minor secondary effect (see the table above).
If the target's alignment is diametrically opposed to yours (such as lawful good/chaotic evil), the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), and the subject suffers a moderate secondary effect (see the table below).
If you cast this spell on the same target in 2 consecutive rounds, any secondary effect the spell has increases by one &quot;step&quot; in severity.
That is, if the spell caused a minor effect on the first casting, it now causes a moderate effect, and if it caused a moderate effect, it now causes a major effect.
Minor and moderate effects end in 1 round per caster level, but major effects are permanent until dispelled.
In all cases, the subject is entitled to a Fortitude save for half damage, and then a Will save to negate the secondary effect, if any.
The target is entitled to this Will save even if the spell duplicated by the secondary effect normally does not permit one.
