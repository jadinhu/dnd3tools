You create one or more 3-foot-diameter balls of lightning that shed light as candles and move under your control.
You can deal a number of damage dice (d6) equal to half your caster level (maximum 10d6), divided however you see fit, although no one ball can deal less than 1d6 points of damage.
For example, a 9th-level caster could create one 4d6 lightning ball, two 2d6 balls, four 1d6 balls, or a 2d6 ball and two 1d6 balls.
On the round in which you cast the spell, the lightning balls appear where you wish in the spell's range, and you may direct their movements as a free action.
On following rounds, you must actively direct the lightning balls to move them; otherwise, they stay at rest and damage any creature in the spaces they occupy.
Directing the movement of all existing lightning balls is a move-equivalent action for you.
A lightning ball has a fly speed of 100 feet with perfect maneuverability.
If a lightning ball enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals electricity damage equal to the assigned number of dice.
The target of a lightning ball can halve this damage with a successful Reflex save.
A ball winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
