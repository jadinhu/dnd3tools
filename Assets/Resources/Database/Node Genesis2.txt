You can cast this spell only while you are on or under the surface of the earth.
The spell's energy reroutes local ley lines and telluric currents, precipitating the creation of a Class 1 earth node.
The new node is 20 feet in diameter, centered on and emanating from the point touched.
The rough boundary of the new earth node may enclose a hollow space, an area of solid rock, or a combination of materials.
If node genesis is cast on the surface of the earth, at least a portion of the earth node must be contiguous with the natural ground.
You have some leeway in determining the initial shape of your earth node's outer boundary ï¿½ ;it doesn't have to be a perfect sphere, though no portion of its volume can be less than 3 cubic feet.
The newly generated earth node retains its Class 1 status for one year.
Thereafter, its diameter increases at a rate of 20 feet per year, until it eventually reaches a diameter equal to 20 feet per caster level you possessed at the time of casting.
When the node's diameter reaches the low end of the range for the next higher class (see Table 4-1), its class increases by +1.
For example, a Class 1 node becomes Class 2 when its diameter reaches 40 feet, and Class 3 when its diameter reaches 120 feet.
Earth nodes you create with this spell are automatically considered node locked by you.
They are otherwise just like natural earth nodes and subject to destruction in the same ways.
XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
Special: You must have the Node Spellcasting feat to cast this spell.
