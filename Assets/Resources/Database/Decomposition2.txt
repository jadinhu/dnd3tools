Whenever an enemy within the area suffers normal (not subdual) damage, that wound festers for an additional 1 point of damage per round thereafter for the duration of the spell.
A successful Heal check (DC 15) or the application of any cure spell or other healing magic (heal, healing circle, and so on) stops the festering.
Only one wound festers at a time; additional wounds suffered while the first is still festering are not subject to this effect.
Once festering has been stopped, however, any new wound suffered while the subject is within the area (before the spell expires) begins the process anew.
For example, a subject who takes 6 points of damage from an attack while within the area of a decomposition spell suffers 1 point of damage from festering the next round, and another 1 point on the round after that.
On the following round, that subject receives 4 points of healing from a cure light wounds spell, so the festering stops and the subject takes no festering damage that round.
The next round, the subject remains within the emanation and takes another 3 points of damage in battle.
The festering begins again, inflicting 1 point of festering damage on the next round.
