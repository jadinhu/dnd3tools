<b>Touch of Madness</b>(Deities and Demigods)

 <b>Level:</b>   Madness 2,   
<b>Components:</b>V, S,

You may daze one living creature by making a successful touch attack.
If the target creature does not make a successful Will save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for 1 round per caster level.
The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.
