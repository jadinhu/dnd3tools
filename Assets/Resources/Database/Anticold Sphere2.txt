<b>As a rosy color flickers into being in the surrounding air, you feel a sense of warmth and well-being.</b>
	
All creatures within the area of the spell gain immunity to cold damage. In addition, the emanation prevents the entrance of any creature with the cold subtype. The effect hedges out such creatures in the area when it is cast.
