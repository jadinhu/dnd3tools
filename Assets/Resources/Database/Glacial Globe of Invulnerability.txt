A frosty sphere of cold energy surrounds you and excludes all spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor of 3rd level or lower.
This spell functions like globe of invulnerability, except that it affects only fire spells.
In addition, the frosty opaqueness of the globe grants concealment (20%miss chance) to those within the area against attacks from outside.
Likewise, targets outside the globe gain concealment against attacks from those within the spell's area.
Arcane Material Component: A tiny sphere of ice that shatters at the expiration of the spell.
