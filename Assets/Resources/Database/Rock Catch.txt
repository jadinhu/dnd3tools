A single creature you touch gains the ability to catch hurled rocks of Small to Large size (including projectiles of a similar shape and size, such as catapult ammunition).
Once per round, as an immediate action (a free action taken during another creature's turn), when the subject of this spell would normally be hit by a rock, he can make a Reflex save to catch it.
The DC for catching a Small or smaller rock is 15, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one.
Caught rocks must be subsequently dropped as part of the action.
