You instantly swap locations with a projected image.
You always arrive exactly where your image previously stood, and you leave a projected image in your wake.
To anyone incapable of discerning that the projected image is an illusion, the image swap occurs without visible clue.
To anyone capable of discerning that the projected image is an illusion, the image swap is effectively identical to a dimension door.
This spell has no effect if you do not have a projected image in effect.
Unlike normal teleport spells, use of Halaster's image swap does not count as breaking one's line of sight with a projected image.
Material Component: A small replica of you (a doll).
