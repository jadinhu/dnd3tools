This spell summons 2d6 mephits of a kind you designate.
These are average mephits, as described in the Monster Manual and in Chapter 6 of this book.
The mephits appear where you choose and act immediately, on your turn.
They attack your opponents to the best of their ability.
If you can communicate with the mephits, you can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
You can dismiss them singly, or in groups, at any time.
Summoned mephits cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can they use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.
Mephits cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.
When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
For example, mephit mob is an earth spell when you cast it to summon salt mephits.
