You gain an enhanced awareness of magical writing within range.
Magical writing such as a glyph of warding, explosive runes, sepia snake sigil, or symbol is covered by a blue nimbus of light (which sheds light equal to a candle).
This reveals the location of the writing but prevents it from being triggered.
You and other creatures could read a book warded by explosive runes, or open a drawer guarded by a glyph of warding, or pass through a doorway protected by a symbol without effect.
This spell covers and negates any active or triggered magical writing (such as a quickly scribed symbol of fear or a triggered symbol of death), although creatures that have already succumbed to the effects of the writing are unaffected.
Once this spell ends, all magical writing in the area can be triggered normally, and active or triggered writings resume their function if they have any duration left.
