The spell envelops the warded creature in a shroud of flickering shadows.
The shroud can, if the caster desires, conceal the wearer's features.
In any case, it grants the recipient a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class plus an additional +1 for every four caster levels (maximum bonus +8).
The subject can see through the armor as if it did not exist and is also afforded darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
Finally, the subject gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against any holy, good, or light spells or effects.
Undead creatures that are subjects of armor of darkness also gain +4 turn resistance.
