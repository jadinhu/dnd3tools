A 1-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand.
You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a dagger.
Attacks with the flame dagger are melee touch attacks, and the blade deals 1d4 points of fire damage plus 1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +10).
Because the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage.
The flame dagger can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, and so on.
This spell does not function underwater.
Material Component: A candle, not necessarily lit.
