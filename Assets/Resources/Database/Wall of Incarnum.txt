You cause a flat, vertical, opaque barrier of incarnum to spring into being.
The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object, but it can be adjacent to such.
It must always be a flat plane, although you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
The wall of incarnum must be anchored to a surface, but this can be a floor, a ceiling, or even a wall.
The wall of incarnum can't be moved once it is created.
A wall of incarnum is 1 inch thick.
It can be dispelled, but it cannot be damaged or broken, and spells cannot pass through it.
Ethereal creatures can pass through it, but any other creature (including the caster) attempting to pass through a wall must succeed on aWill save or be blocked by the barrier.
Regardless of the save's result, the wall of incarnum deals 1d4 points of essentia damage (or Wisdom damage if the creature has no essentia) to the creature.
Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in the wall of
incarnum increases the damage dealt on a failed Will save by 1 point.
Material Component: A tiny, shield-shaped piece of blue quartz.
