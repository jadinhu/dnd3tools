With the sound of low chanting, you invest the target with the power of a steel devil.
While under the effect of this spell, the target is infused with the magical energy and deadly skill of a steel devil.
While the spell is in effect, the target gains a +3 profane bonus on attack rolls and to Armor Class.
This bonus increases by 1 for every adjacent creature that is also under the effect of an investiture of the steel devil spell.
In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the steel devil).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.
Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.
