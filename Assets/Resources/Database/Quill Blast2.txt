<b>Needle-sharp quills emerge from your skin as you begin casting this spell, then fly outward in every direction when you complete the spell.</b>
	
Creatures within the spread of a quill blast are hit by one or more quills, depending on their size: Tiny or smaller, 4 quills; Small, 6 quills; Medium, 8 quills; Large, 10 quills; and Huge or larger, 12 quills.
	
Small or larger creatures that make their saves are struck by half as many quills; Tiny or smaller creatures that make their saves avoid the quills completely.
	
Each quill deals 1d6 points of damage and lodges itself into the creature it hits. Lodged quills impose a noncumulative -1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. All quills can be removed safely as a standard action with a DC 20 Heal check. Otherwise, removing the quills deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.
	
Material Component: A porcupine quill.
