This nasty spell causes a major disease and weakness in those who fail their saving throws.
Afflicted creatures are immediately stricken with a sickening scourge that quickly spreads to cover their entire bodies.
The subject suffers excruciatingly painful and highly debilitating blackened boils, magenta blotches, violet lesions, seeping abscesses, and malignant cysts.
The disease deals 1d3 points of temporary Strength and Dexterity damage per day, unless the creature makes a successful Fortitude save on a particular day.
As with mummy rot, successful saves do not allow the creature to recover.
The symptoms persist until the creature finds some magical means to cure the disease (such as remove disease, heal, or restoration).
Focus: A black whip or riding crop, which is cracked in the direction of the intended victims during the casting of the spell.
