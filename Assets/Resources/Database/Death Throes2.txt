<b>As the killing blow falls, you smile with grim satisfaction even as the light of life fades, knowing that your enemy will soon be joining you in the afterlife.</b>
	
If you are killed, your body is instantaneously destroyed in an explosion that deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to everyone in a 30-foot-radius burst.
	
This explosion destroys your body, preventing any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. A wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore life.
