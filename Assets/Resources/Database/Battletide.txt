The caster steals energy from others, slowing them and speeding him or her.
Targets other than the caster suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls.
As long as at least 1 enemy is affected by the spell, the caster gets one extra partial action each round.
If all the affected enemies free themselves from the spell (by death, entering an antimagic field, receiving a successful dispel magic, and so on), the spell ends.
