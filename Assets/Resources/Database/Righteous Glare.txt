You gain a supernatural gaze attack like that of a ghaele eladrin.
Evil creatures with 5 HD or fewer within 60 feet of you must make a successful Will save or die.
Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a fear spell for 2d10 rounds.
Neutral (neither good nor evil) creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a Will save or suffer the fear effect.
