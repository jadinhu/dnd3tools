You create an area of total darkness.
The darkness is impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, but you can see normally within the blacklit area.
Creatures outside the spell's area, even you, cannot see through it.
You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless you cast it cast on a mobile object.
