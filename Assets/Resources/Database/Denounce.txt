You point your finger and pronounce judgment.
You instill feelings of shame and guilt in a target outsider, imposing a -4 insight penalty on its attack rolls, saves, and checks.
Each round on its turn, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.
(This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity).
Outsiders with the good subtype are immune to denounce.
