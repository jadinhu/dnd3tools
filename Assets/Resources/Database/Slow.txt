An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate.
A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions).
Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.
A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.
Multiple slow effects don't stack.
Slow counters and dispels haste.
Material Component: A drop of molasses.
