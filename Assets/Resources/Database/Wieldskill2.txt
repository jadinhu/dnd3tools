This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance, granting it a +5 competence bonus on a skill check of your choice.
A subject that has no ranks in the designated skill functions as if it had 1/2 rank in the skill and therefore is considered trained in it, even though this 1/2 rank adds nothing to checks made with that skill.
Alternatively, the subject may gain proficiency with a single weapon (simple, martial, or exotic) or armor (light, medium, heavy, or shield) that you designate, as if it had
the appropriate feat.
