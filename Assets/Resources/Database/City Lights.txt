You temporarily absorb all nearby artificial light and release it as a flare.
Any artificial light (including magical and mundane sources) flickers out momentarily, then a burst of light flares from you.
All creatures within the area (except you) are blinded for 1 round if they fail a Fortitude save; regardless of the saving throws success, all creatures in the area are dazzled for 1 minute.
Afterward, the lights return to normal.
Sightless creatures are unaffected.
The spell only functions if at least four active artificial light sources (torches, lanterns, light spells, and so forth) are within 60 feet of the caster.
The spell's name refers to its most common use (in well-lit city streets), but it can function in any area with sufficient lighting.
City lights counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness.
Material Component: A pinch of tinder.
