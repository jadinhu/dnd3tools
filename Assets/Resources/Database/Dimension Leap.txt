You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to another spot within range. The distance traveled must be an increment of 10 feet (10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet, and so on). You always arrive at exactly the spot desired, whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction and distance. You can bring along any objects you are touching as the spell is cast, so long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You cannot bring along other creatures.
	
If this spell would put you in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, the spell fails.
	
<b>Special:</b> A character with any Mark of Passage dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Orien), uses his character level rather than his caster level to determine the distance teleported.
