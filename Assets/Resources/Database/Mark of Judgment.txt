You call upon your deity to mark your foes as enemies of the faith.
Divine energy surges through the area, and for a brief moment a holy symbol of your deity shines from the forehead of each targeted creature.
You and your allies see the mark of judgment on a creature and know to strike it in preference over other unmarked targets.
Whenever a creature succeeds on a melee or ranged attack against any subject of a mark of judgment spell, that attacker heals 2 points of damage.
The targets of this spell must have an alignment that opposes yours on at least one axis ï¿½ ;evil if you are good, lawful if you are chaotic, and so on.
For example, a lawful good cleric can place a mark of judgment upon a chaotic good, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil opponent.
A neutral caster can use this spell against any good, evil, lawful, or chaotic foe.
