You steal energy from others.
Targets other than you suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on saves, attack rolls, and damage rolls.
As long as at least one enemy is affected by the spell, you get one extra partial action each round.
If all the affected enemies free themselves from the spell (by death, entering an antimagic field, receiving a successful dispel magic, and so on), the spell ends.
