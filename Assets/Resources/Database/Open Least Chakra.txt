You use magical energies to pry open one chakra, allowing a creature to form a chakra bind that it otherwise could not.
(The spell has no effect on chakras to which soulmelds or magic items are already bound; in other words, it does not allow you to double bind to a chakra).
You can open a creature's crown, feet, or hands chakra with this spell.
A creature benefiting from this spell can bind a soulmeld or magic item to his opened chakra just as if he had gained the ability to form a chakra bind from a feat or class feature.
