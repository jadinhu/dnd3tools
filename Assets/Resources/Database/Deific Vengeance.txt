When you cast this spell, you call out to a deity, listing the crimes of your target and urging the deity to punish the miscreant.
(The target's alignment is irrelevant to the success of the spell).
The divine power of the angry deity imposes this punishment in the form of a sharp, spiritual blow to the target.
This attack hits automatically and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6), or 1d6 points per caster level (maximum 10d6) if the target is undead.
A successful Will saving throw reduces the damage by half.
