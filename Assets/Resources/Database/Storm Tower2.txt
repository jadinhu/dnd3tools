You form a tower of dark, swirling storm clouds that negates many forms of magic.
The storm tower absorbs any electricity damage dealt to those within it.
Magic missiles cannot be cast into, out of, or within the storm tower.
The storm tower is treated as 60 mph winds (making ranged attacks impossible within the tower), though it has no effect on the movement of creatures within it.
However, only Gargantuan or Colossal creatures can pass through the outer edge of the storm tower; all creatures of lesser size are checked at the edge.
Anyone within the storm tower has one-half concealment relative to those outside the tower.
The howling winds of the storm tower also apply a -10 penalty on all Listen checks within 50 feet of it (including all those inside).
