You conjure into being a block of transparent ice in the shape of any object you have seen at least once before, up to the weight limit (to a maximum of 50 pounds at 10th level).
Any object with moving parts does not function (for example, a crossbow).
You must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.
