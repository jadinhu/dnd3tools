This spell instills in the target an obsessive fascination with the moon. If the target fails its save, it fixates on the moon, staring at the moon or imagining it in its mind, and is considered fascinated for the duration of the spell.
	
If the saving throw is successful, the subject is instead dazzled for the duration of the spell.
	
Sightless creatures are not affected by this spell.
