Areas you designate on the floor flare dimly.
This spell imbues a number of 5-foot squares you designate with a teleportation trap.
A creatures moving through one of these squares and failing its saving throw is teleported 1d6 squares in a random direction (use the Missing with a Thrown Weapon diagram, PH 158).
If reaching the destination involves teleporting the subject into a solid space such as within a wall, the subject is forcibly shunted into the nearest open space and takes 1d6 points of damage.
When you cast this spell, the 5-foot squares you designate do not have to be adjacent but must all be within 30 feet of one another.
Material Component: A pinch of dandelion seeds.
