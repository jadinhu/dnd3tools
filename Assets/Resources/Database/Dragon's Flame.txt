As a master of the Desert Wind advances in his studies, he learns to stoke raging fires with his ki. This maneuver allows you to generate a gout of fire similar to a dragon?s burning breath. With this maneuver, you blast forth a cone of fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to everything in the area. Creatures in the area can attempt Reflex saves (DC 15 + your Wis modifier) for half damage.
This maneuver is a supernatural ability.</p
