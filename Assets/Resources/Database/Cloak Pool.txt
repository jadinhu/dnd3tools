This spell causes a color pool on the Astral Plane � ;an irregular patch of color containing a portal to another plane � ;to seemingly cease to exist.
In truth, it is only hidden from view.
The use of this spell does not hide the area around the pool; it masks only the fact that a pool is present.
See invisibility or true seeing reveals the presence of the pool, as does analyze portal.
