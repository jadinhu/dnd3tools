When you utter the final words of this spell, your muscles and equilibrium shift dramatically, making you feel more at home in the saddle than you do on your own feet.
Upon casting this spell, you gain a +10 bonus on all Ride checks.
If you have special mount or similar class ability, your bonus on Ride checks increases to +20 while you are mounted on your special mount.
If you cast master cavalier along with phantom charge (see below) and war-mount (page 129), the three spells have a synergistic effect.
By shunting a tiny amount of its physical form into the plane from which it normally comes, your mount gains the ability to walk on liquids or even on empty air.
This adjustment grants it a fly speed equal to its normal land-based movement rate, with average maneuverability.
This effect lasts until either master cavalier or war-mount expires.
