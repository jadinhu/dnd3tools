Magic swirls around you and your ally, sparkling with the intensity of secret knowledge.
This spell allows two willing dragonblood creatures to trade known spells.
The two creatures agree upon a spell to swap.
These spells must be of the same level, though not of the same school.
This effect does not grant the creatures the ability to learn more spells.
When a spell is traded, it is no longer in the repertoire of the trader.
Each participant must expend XP equal to 100 times the minimum caster level necessary to cast the spell.
For instance, Darsikh (an 11th-level half-bronze dragon sorcerer) casts this spell to trade with Arethnektilhimon (an old brass dragon who casts as an 11th-level sorcerer).
They agree that Darsikh will give Arethnektilhimon hallucinatory terrain in return for shadow conjuration.
When the trade is decided and the spell cast, each expends 800 XP (100 x; 8, since 8 is the minimum caster level necessary for sorcerers to cast 4th-level spells).
The old spells are no longer in the repertoire of the casters, and are replaced by the spells they have newly chosen.
Material Component: Blood; each participant must take 1d4 points of damage when they cut themselves in a blood ceremony to seal their trade.
XP Cost: 100 x the minimum caster level necessary to cast the traded spells.
Both participants expend this amount.
Special: Only dragons and dragonblood creatures can cast this spell.
