A golden ray springs from your pointing finger.
You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit your intended target.
A corpse or undead creature struck by the ray takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8).
Any Large or smaller creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust.
The ray has no effect on objects that are not corpses; thus, the creature's equipment is unaffected.
A creature that makes a successful Fortitude takes half damage.
