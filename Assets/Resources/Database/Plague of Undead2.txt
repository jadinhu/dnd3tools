This spell unleashes great necromantic power, raising a host of undead creatures.
This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures within the spell's range into undead skeletons or zombies that follow your spoken commands.
The undead remain animated until destroyed (a destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again).
Regardless of the specific numbers or kinds of undead created with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead with this spell than four times your caster level with a single casting of plague of undead.
The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely.
No matter how many times you use this spell or animate dead, however, you can only control 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level.
The limit imposed by this spell and the animate dead spell are the same, meaning that creatures you animate with either spell count against this limit.
If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings of this spell or animate dead become uncontrolled.
Any time that this causes you to release only part of the undead that you control through this spell or animate dead, you choose which undead are released until the total HD of undead you control is equal to four times your caster level.
The bones and bodies required for this spell follow the same restrictions as animate dead (see page 199 of the Player's Handbook ).
All of the bones and bodies to be animated by this spell must be within range when the spell is cast.
Material Component: A black sapphire worth 100 gp or several black sapphires with total value of 100 gp.
