You can sense the presence of creatures who bear a necrotic cyst (see spell of the same name).
The amount of information revealed depends on how long you remain within range of a creature that triggers your cyst awareness: 1st Round: Presence or absence of creatures with necrotic cysts.
2nd Round:Number of creatures bearing necrotic cysts in the area.
3rd Round: The location of each creature bearing a necrotic cyst.
If a cyst-bearer is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
Focus: Caster must possess a mother cyst (see page 28).
