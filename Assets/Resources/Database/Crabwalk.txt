When the subject of this spell charges, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll and takes no penalty to Armor Class. This benefit replaces the normal +2 bonus on attack rolls and -2 penalty to AC that a charge attack normally confers. If the creature is capable of multiple attacks after a charge, such as a lion with the pounce ability, the bonus applies only to the first attack.
