This spell allows you to protect yourself against some condition � ;such as being immersed in boiling oil or being buried under an avalanche � ;that would ordinarily cause certain death.
You can only protect yourself against a natural occurrence or condition, not against a spell or the action of a creature (such as the breath of a dragon or the swords of a group of bandits).
You must specify the condition against which you wish to protect yourself, and the spell is effective only against that condition.
Should you be subjected to that condition during the duration of the spell, you feel no discomfort and take no damage from the condition.
However, the spell does not protect any items carried on your person.
At the end of the spell's duration, the condition has full normal effects on you if you are still subjected to it.
Material Component: An ointment of peach syrup and cinnabar.
