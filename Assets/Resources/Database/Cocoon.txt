You cause silkworm threads to encase your target in a cocoon.
While in the cocoon, the subject is paralyzed.
Gradually, the cocoon leeches energy from the subject until he dies, at which point the cocoon grants powers to its holder.
Once per day, the subject receives one negative level.
If these levels become permanent, the cocoon &quot;stores&quot; the lost energy in its silk threads (up to 10 levels).
The cocoon has 100 hp and hardness 10.
Hacking it off the subject eventually breaks the subject free.
If the cocoon is not allowed to complete its draining of the subject, it becomes useless and conveys no benefits.
However, when the victim is reduced to zero levels, he dies and the cocoon falls off, shrinking to the size of a walnut.
You may then carry the cocoon and draw energy from it.
If carried, the shrunken cocoon grants you a +4 enhancement bonus to the victim's highest ability score (for instance, if the victim's highest ability score was
Wisdom, you would gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your Wisdom).
In the case of a tie, you may select which bonus you get.
If the victim had any ranks in a Knowledge skill, you gain an enhancement bonus on that skill check equal to the number of ranks possessed by the victim.
If the victim was a spellcaster, you gain one free spell slot of the highest spell level the victim could cast (even if those spells were of a different class or type than your own).
The cocoon grants these special powers for one day per level drained from the victim.
If the victim is restored to life before this duration ends, the cocoon immediately loses all powers.
Material Component: A silkworm cocoon.
XP Cost: 1,000 XP.
