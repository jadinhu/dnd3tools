This spell creates a creature constructed from magical ice.
It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn.
It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability.
If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list of either the summon monster table or the summon nature's ally table (pages 287-288 of the Player's Handbook).
The conjured creature cannot have the fire subtype.
You choose which kind of creature to conjure, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.
The conjured creature is a construct made of magical ice, gaining the ice beast template (see page 138).
In all other ways, conjure ice beast I functions like summon monster I.
