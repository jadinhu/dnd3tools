 <b>Target:</b> You
 <b>Duration:</b> Stance

 	
<b>You crouch and set your feet flat on the ground, rooting yourself to the spot you stand. Nothing can move you from this place.</b>
	
Like a living mountain, you choose your position on the battlefield and sink your roots into the earth. With your spot chosen on the field, you cannot be shifted from your position.
	
While you are in this stance, you gain a +10 bonus on checks to resist bull rush, overrun, and trip attacks, as well as on grapple checks made to resist an opponent?s grapple attempt. Any creature
that attempts to move through your threatened area or the space you occupy takes a ?10 penalty on any Tumble checks it makes. This stance also grants you damage reduction 2/?.
	
This stance immediately ends if you move more than 5 feet for any reason, such as from a bull rush attack, a telekinesis spell, and so forth.<
