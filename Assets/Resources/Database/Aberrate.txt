The caster transforms one creature into an aberration.
	
The subject's form twists and mutates into a hideous mockery of itself. The subject's type changes to aberration, and it gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC (due to the toughening and twisting of the flesh) for every four levels the caster has, up to a maximum of +5.
