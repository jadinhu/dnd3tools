An immobile, shimmering tapestry of swirling, pearl-white light springs into existence.
This wall need not be anchored to any surface, and creatures can readily pass through it.
Any undead creature that comes into contact with the wall takes 4d12 points of damage.
A creature of evil alignment, or any creature carrying the holy symbol of Shar or Umberlee, takes 2d10 points of damage.
Magic items that come into contact with the wall glow with a red faerie fire effect for 1d4+1 rounds.
The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet in all directions and creates shadowy illumination in a 40-foot radius.
The wall of moonlight counters and dispels any darkness spell of 4th level or lower within 40 feet of any part of it.
If you evoke the wall so that it appears in a spot occupied by creatures, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.
Wall of moonlight can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of at least 12th level at a cost of 2,000 XP.
