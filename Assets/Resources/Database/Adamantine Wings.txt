You feel an instant of searing pain from your back, which swiftly fades into a sensation of ultimate freedom.
You sprout a pair of dull gleaming wings made of overlapping feathers of dark metal.
You grow a pair of adamantine wings.
The wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor or carry a medium or heavy load), with good maneuverability.
If you are not flying, you can use a standard action to make one wing attack or a full attack action to make two such attacks (as if they were natural weapons).
Each wing deals 2d6 points of slashing damage (plus your Strength modifier), and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
The wings are considered both magic and adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or penetrating hardness.
Wing strikes are not additional attacks; they replace any other attack or full attack action.
As a swift action, you can choose to launch the adamantine feathers as a burst of razor-sharp blades.
This attack takes the form of a 60-foot cone-shaped burst.
All creatures within the cone take 10d6 points of damage (Reflex half; spell resistance applies).
Since this is a spell effect, damage reduction does not affect the damage dealt by the cone.
This action immediately ends the spell's duration.
