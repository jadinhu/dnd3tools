This spell, created by a coronal of Cormanthyr from days long past, imbues a number of targets with devastating speed in battle.
Each subject of Sakkratar's triple strike can take two extra attacks when making a full attack action, provided that it attacks with a melee weapon it is holding.
These extra attacks are made using the subject's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation.
In addition, each affected creature's melee weapon bursts into pure white flame, gaining the keen and flaming burst special abilities for the duration of the spell.
This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a haste spell or a weapon of speed, nor does it grant an extra action.
Material Component: A three-faceted prism.
