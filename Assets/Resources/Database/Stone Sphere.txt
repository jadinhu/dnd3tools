<b>You toss the marble in the air, and it vanishes as you speak the words of the spell. A larger version of the marble, five feet across, appears in the hallway and bears down on your foe.</b>
	
You create a smoothly polished, 5-foot-diameter sphere of stone that moves under your control at a speed of 30 feet. A stone sphere has AC 5, hardness 8, and 500 hit points.
	
In the round when you cast the spell, the stone sphere appears at the spot you designate within the spell's range, and you can direct its movement as a free action. In subsequent rounds, you must actively direct the stone sphere in order to move it; otherwise, it remains motionless. Directing the movement of a stone sphere in any round after its initial appearance requires a move action.
	
If you move a stone sphere into a square occupied by an enemy, it stops moving and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to every creature in that square. A successful Reflex save negates the damage.
	
Material Component: A smooth sphere of marble 1 inch in diameter.
