Once per round for the spell?s duration, the wielder of the targeted weapon can declare a single melee attack to be a fracturing blow. If that attack successfully deals damage to an opponent, the foe takes a ?5 penalty to Armor Class and damage reduction (if any, to a minimum of 0).
	
The penalties are applied after the damage from the fracturing weapon attack has been resolved. The penalties last for a single round, but the wielder can attack it again on his or her next turn and attempt to reinvoke the penalty.</
