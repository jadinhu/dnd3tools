You gain a perception of the forces of magic and can sense when magic is being manipulated by a spellcaster.
You gain a +5 competence bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify a spell as it is being cast.
If you have at least 5 ranks in Spellcraft, you are also able to sense the use of any spell or spell-like ability within 100 feet, so long as you have line of effect to the caster.
With a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level) you can even ascertain the spell being cast.
This determination happens quickly enough that you can
attempt to counter the spell as a free action.
Counterspell attempts are otherwise handled normally, and you can counter the spell even if you do not have line of sight to the spellcaster.
If you counter a spell in this manner, the battlemagic perception spell ends immediately.
