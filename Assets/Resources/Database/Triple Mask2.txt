You create three shadow duplicates of yourself.
These images look, sound, and smell like you but are intangible.
You can switch your perceptions to any shadow or your own body as a free action on your turn.
When you use the perceptions of a shadow, it mimics your actions (including speech) unless you concentrate on making it act differently.
Any shadows you are not controlling remain motionless and unreactive.
If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from a controlled shadow instead of from you.
(The shadows are quasi-real � ;just real enough to cast spells that you originate).
A shadow can cast only spells that affect shadows on itself.
The shadows behave like the servant conjured by an unseen servant spell.
They are mindless, so while they can perform simple tasks such as opening doors, they cannot perform complex tasks such as puzzle solving.
A controlled shadow can also be programmed to move in a particular direction or to a location you know.
It moves at your speed and continues to move in this manner until either it reaches its destination or you shift your perceptions to it and program it to go somewhere else.
If you use dimension door, teleport, plane shift, or a similar spell that removes you from the same plane as the shadows, even momentarily, the spell ends.
Normally this spell is used to give you several false bodies � ;one that acts as a safe haven for casting spells (similar to project image) and the other two as distractions.
