You give the target a vision of what awaits it in the afterlife.
Since most evil creatures go to an evil plane where they take the form of a lowly and much-tortured petitioner (barring special arrangements with evil gods or fiends that grant them higher status in the afterlife), this is usually a gut-wrenching vision.
The target is nauseated; if it makes its saving throw, it is instead sickened (see page 301 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for definitions of these conditions.
Sacrifice Component: 1d2 points of Strength damage.
