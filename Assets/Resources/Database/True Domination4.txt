 <b>Level:</b>   Domination 8,   
<b>Components:</b>V, S, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
 <b>Target:</b> One humanoid
 <b>Duration:</b> 24 hours/level

<b>Reaching out with your thoughts, you grasp the mind of your foe and take command of its actions.</b>
	
You can control the actions of any humanoid. You establish a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If a common language is shared, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language is shared, you can communicate only basic commands, such as &quot;Come here,&quot; &quot;Go there,&quot; &quot;Fight,&quot; and &quot;Stand still.&quot; You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it.
	
Subjects have a chance of resisting this control by making a Will save to avoid the effect when the spell is cast. Those affected by the spell and then forced to take actions against their nature receive a new saving throw with a -4 penalty. Obviously self-destructive orders might be carried out, unless the subject can make a saving throw with the -4 penalty. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.
	
Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or dispel it.
