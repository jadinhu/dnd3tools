You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object.
The spell locates such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder.
You can search for general items such as a stairway, a sword, or a jewel, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range.
Attempting to find a certain item, such as a particular piece of jewelry, requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails.
You cannot specify a unique item (such as &quot;Baron Vulden's signet ring&quot;) unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination).
The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead.
Creatures cannot be found by this spell.
Polymorph any object fools it.
Arcane Focus: A forked twig.
