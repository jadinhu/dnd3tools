A missile of lava darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage.
The missile strikes unerringly if the target has less than total cover or concealment.
Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out.
A target that fails its saving throw catches on fire (see Catching on Fire in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
For every two caster levels, you gain an additional missile ï¿½ ;
two at 4th level, three at 6th level, four at 8th level, and the maximum of five at 10th level or higher.
If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures.
A single missile can strike only one creature.
You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.
A lava missile cures firenewts of 1d4 points of damage.
This spell was first used by firenewt clerics of Kossuth.
