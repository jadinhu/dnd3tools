Jarring, discordant noises fill the area, making it difficult for others to concentrate.
You create a zone of disruptive arcane harmonies that interfere with spells that have verbal components.
Casters within the area find their spells' spoken words warped, twisted, and blurred, disrupting their efforts.
Any creature (other than you) that attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component in this area must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 20 + the spell's level).
On a failure, the spell fails to function and the caster expends the spell or spell slot as normal.
Harmonic void has no effect on supernatural abilities, magic
items, and other magical effects.
It affects only spells with verbal components.
