<b>Whirling your pointed finger through a complex gesture, you create a cool and fresh mist that cleanses the air of pollutants.</b>
	
You surround yourself with a purifying, swirling mist htat washes the air clean of smoke, dust, and poisons. Nonmagical contaminants, including inhaled poisons, are automatically negated within the cloud. <b>Dance of the unicorn</b> also grants everyone within the mist a +4 bonus on saving throws against magical or supernatural gas effects, such as <b>acid fog</b>, <b>cloudkill</b>, and green dragon breath.
	
The cloud of mist leaves everything within its area damp.
