<b>Like a cornered wolverine, you fight with unmatched ferocity and rage when your opponents force you into close quarters.</b>
	
When an opponent has you in his grasp, you transform into a snarling, frothing, raging beast. You hack with your weapon at your foe?s arms or tentacles, your wild frenzy allowing you to fight even with a large, awkward weapon. When you are in the grasp of a larger foe, your frenzy ignites into an inferno as you desperately attempt to break free.
	
While you are in this stance, you can attack a foe grappling you with any one-handed weapon. You do not take the ?4 penalty for fighting while grappled. If your foe is of a larger size category than yours, your feral rage ignites and grants you a +4 bonus on damage rolls against that creature while it continues to grapple you.</
