By making a strumming, drumming, or whistling gesture, you negate any magical silence in the area.
This zone of negation moves with you and lasts as long as you continue the performance.
The silence is not dispelled but simply held in abeyance; it remains in effect outside the area of the joyful noise.
Thus, this spell is usually used to move a group out of range of a silence effect.
Focus: The caster's instrument.
