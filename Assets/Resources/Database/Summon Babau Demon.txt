This spell summons a babau demon from the Infinite Layers of the Abyss.
It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn.
It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability.
You must concentrate on the spell's effect, but commanding the creature is a free action.
A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.
