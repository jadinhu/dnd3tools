Your skin tingles as you radiate a field of powerful magic.
When you cast this spell, designate either a school of magic or a subtype of magic (such as evil spells or fire spells).
Spells of that type are suppressed within the area of your spell.
Anyone attempting to cast such a spell in (or into) the area must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level.
(Abilities and feats that improve the ability to defeat spell resistance, such as Spell Penetration, apply here as well).
Anyone attempting to activate an item that produces a spell or effect of that type must make a similar roll, using the item's caster level for the level check.
Constant items or precast effects make this check when first exposed to your suppressing field.
If they succeed, they remain unaffected for the duration.
If they fail, they are suppressed for the duration, resuming function (if their duration has not expired) when they leave the area.
