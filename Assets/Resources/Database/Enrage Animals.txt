This spell incites and enrages animals, making them hostile and vicious.
Only ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell.
The maximumnumber of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + your caster level.
A dire animal or an animal trained only to attack on order is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not.
For example, a ranger could enrage a normal bear or wolf with little trouble, but it's more difficult to drive a trained guard dog into a frenzy so that it attacks its master.
The affected creatures attack the nearest creature, including any other creatures affected by this spell.
