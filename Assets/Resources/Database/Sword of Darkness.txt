<b>Sword of Darkness</b>(Complete Arcane)

Necromancy [Evil]
 <b>Level:</b>  Sorcerer 7,  Wizard 7,  Wu Jen 7,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, M, 
 <b>Effect:</b> Black blade of negative energy

 	
This spell functions as sword of deception, except you cause a black blade of pure negative energy to appear and attack opponents at a distance, as directed by you.
A sword of darkness bestows one negative level on each successful hit against a living creature, threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and bestows an additional negative level on a critical hit.
Negative levels usually have a chance of permanently draining the subject's levels, but the negative levels from sword of darkness don't last long enough to do so.
However, if the subject gains at least as many negative levels as it has Hit Dice, it dies.
If the sword strikes an undead creature, it grants that creature 5 temporary hit points per two caster levels (maximum 25 temporary hit points) that last for up to 1 hour.
Material Component: A katana, bastard sword, or longsword, which is shattered against a stone while casting the spell.
