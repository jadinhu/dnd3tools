This spell alters the coloration of the recipient to match that of the surrounding background.
The creature gains a +10 circumstance bonus on its Hide check.
When moving through areas where the background changes gradually (such as stepping from the edge of a forest into a green field), the coloration changes immediately.
When the background changes abruptly (from forest to gray stone wall), 1 round is required to effect the change in coloration.
Material Component: The shed skin of a small lizard.
