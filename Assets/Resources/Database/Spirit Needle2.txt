When you cast this spell, you hurl a long needle at a spirit creature, making a normal ranged attack against the spirit.
The needle can hit incorporeal and even ethereal creatures, though it has no enhancement bonus.
If you hit, the spirit becomes corporeal and is held in place, unable to move for the duration of the spell (though it can still take nonmovement actions, including attacks).
The spirit takes no damage from the needle, but it becomes much more vulnerable to further attacks, losing any Dexterity bonus to AC and giving attackers a +4 bonus on attack rolls, in addition to losing the protective benefits of incorporeality.
The spirit cannot remove the needle that pins it in place, but another creature can remove it by using the aid another action.
A pinned spirit is unable to use any supernatural or spell-like ability to alter its substance (such as gaseous form, ethereal jaunt, or becoming incorporeal again) or transport itself (including dimension door and teleport).
Focus: A long metal needle.
