All the subject's memories and knowledge are accessible to you, ranging from memories deep below the surface to those still easily called to mind.
You can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the subject's knowledge.
You can also probe a sleeping subject, though the subject may make a Will save against the DC of the probe thoughts spell to wake after each question.
Subjects who do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the power's range, unless somehow hindered.
You pose the questions telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind.
You and the target do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to your questions.
