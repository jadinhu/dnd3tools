Ghostly images of elemental beasts fly from your outstretched arm, striking foes and placing a shadowy curse upon them.
This spell places a curse on the targets, making them more susceptible to your magical attacks.
When you cast this spell, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire; any creature affected by the spell takes an extra 1d6 points of damage from any of your spells that deal damage of that energy type.
The extra damage isn't added to other effects, such as a weapon's flaming special ability, nor does it apply to damage dealt by other characters.
As part of the casting of this spell, you can sacrifice one additional sorcerer spell slot of up to 9th level; doing this increases the extra damage from the spell by 1 point per level of the sacrificed slot.
For example, if you spend a 4th-level spell slot to cast curse of the elemental lords and a 6th-level spell slot to augment it, the resulting curse adds 1d6+6 points of damage to the damage taken by targets of your spells of the chosen energy type.
Curse of the elemental lords can't be dispelled, but it can be removed by any effect that would remove a curse.
Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), the extra damage from this spell also applies to your breath weapon (assuming that it deals the appropriate type of damage).
