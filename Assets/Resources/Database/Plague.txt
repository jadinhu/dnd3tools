Your skin crawls as you utter the words and complete the gestures of this spell.
Suddenly, one or more of the target creatures seem overcome by a dreadful malady.
The subjects contract a disease selected from the table below, which strikes immediately (no incubation period).
The disease progresses rapidly; the subjects must attempt additional saves each round, instead of each day.
Use plague's DC for all saves.
See page 292 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information on these diseases.
