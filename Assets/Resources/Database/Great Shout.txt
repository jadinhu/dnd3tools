You emit a thunderous, devastating yell.
The primary area affected is 5 feet high and 5 feet wide, extending out from you to the limit of the spell's range.
Stone, crystal, and metal objects in the area take 20d6 points of damage.
Creatures holding vulnerable objects can attempt Reflex saves to negate the damage.
Objects that survive the spell's primary effect are not subject to the secondary effect.
The spell's secondary effect is a cone of sound.
Creatures within the cone take 10d6 points of damage, and are stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds.
A successful Fortitude save negates the stunning and halves both the damage and the duration of the deafness.
Any brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
Creatures holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with successful Reflex saves.
The great shout spell cannot penetrate the spell silence.
Focus: A small metal or ivory horn.
