<b>With a crackle of popping joints and tendons, your hands and fingers become long curving claws with heavy knuckles.</b>
	
You gain two claw attacks that act as slashing melee weapons, dealing 1d4 points of damage with a threat range of 19 � ;20. Attacks with your trans- formed hands do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
	
Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks � ;you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus.
	
If you attack with a manufactured weapon or another natural attack, you can't make any claw attacks in that round. The claws do not hinder your manual dexterity or spellcasting.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> The claw of a bird of prey, such as an eagle or falcon.
