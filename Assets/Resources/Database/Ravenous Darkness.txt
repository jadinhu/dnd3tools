Tendrils of shadow leap from the object you've touched, then swiftly form into an all-encompassing wave.
The spreading night seems to blot out both light and life.
The object touched sheds darkness as a deeper darkness spell (PH 217).
In addition, every living creature within the area of the resulting darkness (a 60-foot radius) takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage per round.
Any creature under the influence of an ongoing negative energy effect (such as negative levels or necromantic-based ability damage) instead takes 2d6 points of damage per round.
This effect ends for a given creature if it moves out of the area of darkness but resumes should it reenter.
A successful Fortitude save negates the damage, but the affected creaturemust repeat the save every round, whether it succeeds or fails.
If a creature has spell resistance, the spell must overcome it to deal damage.
Any undead creature within the darkness instead gains fast healing 1.
Ravenous darkness counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
