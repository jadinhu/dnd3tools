This spell wards a creature from attacks by Shadowlands creatures and creatures with the Shadowlands Taint, from mental control, and from summoned or conjured creatures.
It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot.
The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects:
First, the subject gets a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves.
Both these bonuses apply against attacks made by creatures with the Shadowlands subtype and creatures with a Taint score.
Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (as by a magic jar attack) or to exercise mental control over the creature (as by a vampire's supernatural domination ability, which works similar to dominate person).
The protection does not prevent a vampire's domination itself, but it prevents the vampire from mentally commanding the protected creature.
If the protection from Taint effect ends before the domination effect does, the vampire would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature.
Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.
This second effect works regardless of alignment.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures (see the Monster Manual).
This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature.
Good elementals and outsiders are immune to this effect.
The protection against contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.
