<b>You clutch the quartz in your hand, focusing the energy of the spell into a sharp spear. With a thought, you send it whistling through the air at your foe.</b>
	
You must succeed on a normal ranged attack to strike a target with an <b>icelance</b>. You gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll. If you hit, the <b>icelance</b> deals 6d6 points of damage to the target. Half of this damage is piercing damage; the rest is cold damage. In addition, the target must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Regardless of the result of the attack, the <b>icelance</b> shatters upon its first use.
	
<b>Focus</b>: A 50-gp clear quartz gemstone. Alternatively, if you are in a cold region, you can substitute 10 pounds of ice or snow for the quartz.
