This spell reduces the sun's light to a comfortable glow in a stationary area, dropping the temperature by 20 degrees.
Creatures inside the effect gain a one-step improvement in protection against heat, are not subject to sunburn, and can begin to recover from sun glare and nonlethal damage due to heat (see Chapter 1).
Impede sun's brilliance has no effect on light, daylight, sunburst,
and similar magical light effects, and it offers no protection from damage that creatures vulnerable to sunlight might take from the sun.
