This spell produces a brief windstorm (approximately 70 mph), filled with scouring, supernatural grit that literally strips flesh.
In addition to the possible effects of the wind, creatures within the area of a flaywind burst spell take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) from the scouring sands.
A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
A creature within the area of flaywind burst must make a Fortitude save or experience the effects of the wind's force.
A Small or smaller creature is knocked down and rolled 1d4x;10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.
If flying, a Small or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x;10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.
Medium creatures are knocked prone, or if flying are blown back 1d6x;10 feet.
Large or Huge creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the blast, or if flying are blown back 1d6x;5 feet.
Gargantuan or larger creatures can move normally within a flaywind burst.
Flaywind burst can't move a creature beyond its range.
In addition to the effects noted, flaywind burst can do anything else that a windstorm-force sandstorm would be expected to do, such as briefly obscure vision, heel over a boat, or blow gases and vapors to the limit of its area.
Material Component: A pinch of sand and the wing feather of a vulture.
