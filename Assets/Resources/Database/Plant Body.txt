You imbue the subject with powerful transformative magic, granting it some of the characteristics of the plant type.
The subject's skin becomes covered over with moss and ivy, not unlike the appearance of a shambling mound.
Any spell or effect that affects plant creatures also affects the subject.
A plant creature is immune to critical hits, mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing.
The subject's ability scores, skills, and feats are unaffected (although its new form may make it difficult or impossible for the subject to use certain skills or feats).
