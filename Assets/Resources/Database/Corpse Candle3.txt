A ghostly hand bearing a lit candle appears at the spot you choose.
The candle sheds light in a 5-foot radius.
The hand moves as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, and so on The hand can move up to 50 feet per round.
It winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.
The hand and candle are incorporeal and can pass through objects, making it a useful tool in simulating hauntings.
The corpse candle illuminates hidden, ethereal, and invisible beings and items, which become faintly visible as wispy outlines.
Ethereal creatures remain unreachable from the Material Plane (except with force effects), but invisible creatures have only three-quarters concealment while within 5 feet of the candle.
The ghostly radiance also makes immaterial creatures and items ever so slightly material (including the hand itself).
Incorporeal creatures within 5 feet of the corpse candle retain all the usual benefits of being incorporeal, but they have only a 30% chance to avoid attacks from corporeal creatures.
The hand is Diminutive, has 1 hit point per caster level, and has AC 14+ a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.
It makes saves as you do.
It is immune to spells that don't cause damage (other than disintegrate).
The spell effect ends if the hand is destroyed.
Material Component: A piece of a corpse that has never been treated with any kind of preservative.
