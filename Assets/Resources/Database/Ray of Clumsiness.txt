<b>A crackling ray leaps from your outstretched hand. The green ray seems almost sluggish in reaching its target, though it takes only an eyeblink to do so.</b>
	
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The energy of the ray stiffens the subject's muscles and joints, making it more difficult for the subject to move. The subject takes a penalty to Dexterity equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum penalty 1d6+5, minimum Dexterity 1).
