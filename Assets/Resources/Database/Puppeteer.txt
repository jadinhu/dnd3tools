You force your subject to mimic your actions.
Your subject matches your motions exactly, though she suffers a -4 penalty to Dexterity and Strength.
She looks awkward, and her actions aren't as effective as if she were actually doing them herself.
You can make the subject commit a suicidal act, but she receives another Will save to break the spell.
If successful, she collapses, helpless in a comatose state, for 1d4 rounds.
Controlling the subject requires concentration.
If your concentration is ever interrupted, you may resume control of the subject as a free action on your turn.
Anyone observing the subject of this spell can determine that the subject's actions are being controlled with a Sense Motive check (DC 15, or DC 10 if the controlling bard is also visible).
This spell doesn't grant the subject extraordinary, supernatural, spell-like abilities, or spellcasting abilities, even if you have and use such abilities during the spell's duration.
