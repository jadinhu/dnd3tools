<b>Instinctively, you know the depth of the nearest pool of water, as well as other pools nearby of a similar depth. In your mind's eye you see the pools connected to one another magically, as if each were a doorway with a tunnel linking it to all the others.</b>
	
This spell functions like <b>tree stride</b> (PH 296), but it is used for diving into pools of water rather than trees. Each pool must be at least 1 foot deep, and the exit pool of water must be similar in depth to the entry pool (within 1 foot). Unlike with tree stride, each jump has a maximum range of 500 feet. All other effects and limitations are the same.
