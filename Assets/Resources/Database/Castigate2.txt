This spell allows you to verbally rebuke foes.
By shouting your deity's teachings about other alignments, you inflict pain on those who hear, and those in the area need not understand your divine words to be affected.
This spell has no effect on creatures that cannot hear.
Otherwise, you deafen foes of the same alignment for 1d4 rounds (save for half).
Foes within one alignment step of your alignment (lawful, neutral, chaotic; good or evil) take 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum 10).
Foes whose alignment is more than one step different from yours take 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4).
A saving throw is allowed for half damage from this spell.
