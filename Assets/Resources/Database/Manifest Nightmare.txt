The target's greatest fear appears before him in illusory formfor all to see.
So long as the nightmare remains manifest and in the subject's proximity, he must make a Will save every round or become panicked.
Success on this save indicates that the subject is only shaken that round.
This save is repeated every round for the spell's duration, until and unless the subject makes a successful save to disbelieve the illusion.
In order to disbelieve the illusion, the subject must first force himself to interact with it, to determine that it might be false.
Many casters use this spell simply to learn the nature of the subject's greatest fear, not caring whether the illusion actually causes the subject to panic.
