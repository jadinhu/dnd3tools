You permanently place a mark upon a character or creature that identifies it as an enemy of the faith.
Anyone of your faith who encounters the bearer of a mark of the unfaithful, even if he is disguised, altered, or polymorphed, feels a natural hostility toward that person and gains a +6 circumstance bonus on Sense Motive checks made against the marked creature.
This hostility might not induce the viewer to attack, but he certainly will not be inclined to trust or believe anything the marked one says.
Clerics, paladins, druids and rangers of the faith can automatically detect the mark simply by looking at the subject.
A mark of the unfaithful is permanent until dispelled or removed by a cleric of the same faith, of higher level than the caster, who casts an atonement spell upon the subject.
Focus: The subject's name must be inscribed in a book or scroll especially consecrated for this purpose and detailing the crimes (real or imagined) for which the subject is being marked.
