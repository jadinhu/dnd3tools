<b>As you mutter this spell, your words burrow into your foes' minds like hungry maggots, spawning dark and disturbing thoughts.</b>
	
You can choose to inflict one of the following conditions upon any creatures that fail their saving throws:
	
<b>Hysteria:</b> The subjects fall into fits of uncontrollable laughing or crying (equal chance for either). This hysteria affects subjects as though they were nauseated; they are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action a subject can take is a single move action per turn.
	
<b>Panic:</b> The subjects become panicked. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers.
	
<b>Violent Hallucinations:</b> The subjects perceive any nearby creatures as dangerous enemies, attacking the nearest ones and fighting until the subjects are slain or until no more creatures are in sight.
	
<b>Stupor:</b> The subjects curl up on the floor and remain oblivious to events around them. Characters in a stupor are effectively stunned and prone.
