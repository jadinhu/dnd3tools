<b>As you call upon divine power to fuel your spell, you feel the air around you become chilled. The drop in temperature creates a thin fog that exacerbates the cold in the air without hindering your vision or movement whatsoever.</b>
	
This spell causes a powerful cold front to form, lowering the temperature in the affected area by 5 degrees Fahrenheit per caster level (maximum change of 50 degrees Fahrenheit), to a maximum low of ï¿½ ;20 degrees Fahrenheit (see Cold Dangers, <span class="caps">DMG</span> 302). Spells with the cold descriptor deal an extra 1 point of damage per die when cast in the area.
