The power of your deity courses through you, re-placing what you once knew with different ideas and abilities.
Upon casting substitute domain, you can swap one of your current domains for another that your deity offers.
You gain the granted power of the new domain, as well as access to any of its spells that you can cast � ;though you must still prepare the spells normally.
While substitute domain is in effect, you lose the granted powers and spells of the domain to which you have given up access.
For example, Saera, a cleric of Pelor, normally has access to the Strength and Sun domains.
She casts substitute domain.
on herself and chooses to swap the Strength domain for another of the domains that Pelor normally grants � ;
namely Healing.
While she can now access the spells and granted power of the Healing domain, Saera cannot tap the abilities and spells normally associated with the Strength domain.
