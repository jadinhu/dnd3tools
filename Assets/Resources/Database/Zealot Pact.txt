This spell creates a binding agreement between a deity and the target that grants the target a measure of divine power to crush the deity's enemies.
Once this spell is cast, the pact remains dormant until the target successfully hits a foe whose alignment is exactly opposite that of the deity.
The target's subsequent melee attacks gain a +4 bonus, deal double damage, and automatically confirm critical hits for the spell's duration.
Furthermore, the target's melee attacks have alignment descriptors that match the deity with whom you've made the pact.
The target is compelled to attack foes of opposite alignment every round if able to do so.
The target knows which creatures within 60 feet are of opposite alignment (as if the relevant detect spells had been cast).
If you create a zealot pact with a completely neutral deity such as Obad-Hai, choose one alignment from the following list that triggers the zealot pact: lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic evil, or chaotic good.
A creature can be subject to only one zealot pact at a time.
Casting zealot pact on a target who already has an untriggered zealot pact voids the earlier pact.
XP Cost: 500 XP.
