A single arrow gleams like a star in the night, promising a deathlike slumber to its target.
At any time during this spell's duration, you can use a swift action to imbue an arrow that you hold with the power of slumber.
Any creature of 15 HD or less that is dealt damage by this arrow before the end of your turn falls asleep for 1 hour.
A successful Will save means the target becomes fatigued for 1 hour instead.
Any arrow that doesn't deal damage to a target before your turn ends loses its magic (but can be imbued again on your next turn).
You can imbue one arrow for every three caster levels you have (maximum five arrows).
Material Component: A few poppy seeds.
