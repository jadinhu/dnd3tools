This spell was developed by demonic spellcasters ages ago for use against their ancient foes, the devils of Baator.
It deals 2d6 points of damage to creatures that have both the lawful and evil subtypes (such as a barghest or a devil).
No saving throw is allowed against this damage.
If the target creature also possesses the baatezu subtype, the spell has a much more powerful effect.
The target's mind reels, confusing it for 1d6 rounds and dealing 2d6 points of damage in each of those rounds.
A successful Will save negates the confusion effect and reduces the duration to 1 round.
Such creatures' spell resistance does not apply against this effect.
