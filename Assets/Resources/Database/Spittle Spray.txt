You can spit out to close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels).
If you have a poison bite attack, this spell allows you to spit your poison out to this range.
You make a ranged touch attack to hit your foe, and if you succeed, the target must make a saving throw against your poison as if it had been bitten.
This spell is normally used by the yuan-ti and has no significant effect if used with normal spittle.
