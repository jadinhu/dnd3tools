You create a mystical connection with a single inanimate object.
When that object is damaged, moved, or touched at any later time, you are instantly aware of the fact.
If another creature physically touches the object, you also receive a mental image of the creature, which counts as firsthand knowledge of the creature should you later choose to cast scrying or a similar spell on that creature.
The watchware is activated when the item is disturbed for any reason, whether someone touches it or pokes it with a pole, a cat walks on it, or an earthquake knocks it over.
The watchware functions only once and is then discharged.
Since its components are expensive, most sorcerers and wizards reserve watchware to protect valuable, out-of-the-way items.
A watchware is a magical trap.
A rogue can find a watchware with a successful Search check (DC 25 + spell level, or 30 for watchware) and disarm it with a successful Disable Device check (DC 25 + spell level, or 30 for watchware).
You can designate a password that allows another creature to handle the object without sounding the mental alarm if you so choose.
Material Component: A sprinkling of rare sands and powdered reagents worth at least 500 gp.
