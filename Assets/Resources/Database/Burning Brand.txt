<b>Your weapon transforms into a roaring gout of flame. As you swing your burning blade, it stretches out beyond your normal reach to scorch your foes.</b>
	
When you initiate this maneuver, your weapon turns into a burning brand for the rest of your turn. The brand increases your reach by 5 feet, and your melee attacks made with the brand deal fire damage equal to your normal melee damage. You still gain all the normal benefits from a high Strength score, feats, and other effects that increase your melee damage. For example, an attack with a longsword that normally deals 1d8+4 points of slashing damage would instead deal 1d8+4 points of fire damage. You otherwise attack with your weapon as normal. 
This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
