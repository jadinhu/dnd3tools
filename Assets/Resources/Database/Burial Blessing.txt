By means of this spell, the cleric wards a corpse from evil influences and effects.
Unless the corpse is desecrated or the blessing is countered, the corpse cannot be magically animated or rise as an undead minion (a ghoul or vampire, for example).
Also, anyone trying to disturb the body is struck by a sudden fear and must make a Will save or flee the location for 1 minute per caster level.
If the protected corpse is subsequently brought back to life, the burial blessing ends.
Material Component: The caster's holy symbol and a vial of holy or unholy water, according to alignment, which is sprinkled on the corpse.
XP Cost: 100 XP.
