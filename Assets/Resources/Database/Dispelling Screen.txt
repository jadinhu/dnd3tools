<b>By tossing down the sheet of crystal in your hand and completing the mysterious words of power needed to release the energy of the spell, you create an immobile, shimmering screen of violet energy.</b>
	
Any spell effect operating on a creature or unattended object that passes through the screen is affected as by a targeted <b>dispel magic</b> (<b>PH</b> 223) at your caster level. Attended items that pass through are not affected by the screen, which is the only way the screen differs from a normal targeted casting of <b>dispel magic</b> items are essentially not targeted by the screen. Make a caster level check (1d20 + 1 per caster level, maximum +10) to dispel spell effects (DC 11 + caster level) or suppress an unattended object's magical properties for 1d4 rounds (DC equal to the item's caster level). Spell effects not operating on objects or creatures cannot pass through the screen. A <b>disintegrate</b> or successful <b>dispel magic</b> removes <b>dispelling screen</b>, while an <b>antimagic field</b> suppresses it.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A sheet of fine lead crystal.
