Your touch transforms a living creature into a spongy, amorphous mass, its shape melting and writhing uncontrollably.
An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item.
Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless.
Large items worn or carried � ;armor, backpacks, and even shirts � ;hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4.
Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less.
The victim becomes blind and cannot cast spells or use magic items, and searing pain renders it incapable of attacking.
While in this form, the creature has immunity to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks due to its amorphous nature.
Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock.
If the victim's Wisdom score is reduced to 0, it falls unconscious.
A conscious victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a new Fortitude save.
Success ends the spell effect.
