To randomly determine the subject's destination, roll 1d8 to determine the direction, then roll 1d10 times 10 to determine the distance from the subject's previous location.Roll direction and distance again if this new destination is outside your line of sight, within a solid object, or more than 5 feet above ground.
	
If your target is being held (whether an object held by a character or a character being grappled by a creature), the holding or grappling creature also receives a Will saving throw to resist.
