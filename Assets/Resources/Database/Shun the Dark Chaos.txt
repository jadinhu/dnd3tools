You remove a vestige of the creature's Abyssal heritage, making it seem less fiendish.
You strip the taint of the Abyss from the creature touched.
If the subject possesses any Abyssal heritor feats, one of them is immediately removed and replaced by any other feat for which the subject qualifies (except an Abyssal heritor feat).
The subject chooses both the feat lost and its replacement.
If the lost Abyssal heritor feat was a prerequisite for other feats or prestige classes, the recipient loses access to those feats or prestige class abilities until it once again meets all the prerequisites.
The subject can regain its original Abyssal heritor feat (and lose the replacement feat) by means of embrace the dark chaos,miracle, or wish.
XP Cost: 250 XP.
