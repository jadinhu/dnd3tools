You summon your special mount from the celestial planes where it resides.
This works exactly as your normal, spell-like class ability to summon the creature, except that the duration is shorter and you are not limited in how many times you can call the mount in a day (except by how many times you can cast call mount).
You can cast this spell even if you have already called your mount using your class ability on the same day.
