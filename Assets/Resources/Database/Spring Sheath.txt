You can use this spell to turn an ordinary weapon sheath into a helpful magic device.
Any quick hand motion in front of the affected weapon-holding device (a free action) causes the weapon inside to shoot forth of its own volition and settle into your hand.
The overall effect is the same as that of the Quick Draw feat.
Although this spell is usually cast on a sword sheath, it also works on the straps, buckles, and pockets that hold other weapons.
You could, for example, cast spring sheath on the strap of the backpack that usually holds your longbow to make that weapon fly into your hand.
