Shadow Hand (Strike)
 <b>Level:</b>  Swordsage 1,    
<b>Components:</b>
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Melee attack
 <b>Target:</b> One creature
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial

 	
<b>Your weapon transforms into solid darkness. When it strikes home, it discharges in a swirling orb of shadow that engulfs your foe?s eyes.</b>
	
As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. If it hits, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, and your opponent must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 11 + your Wis modifier) or suffer a 20% miss chance on all melee and ranged attacks for 1 round. A successful save negates the miss chance, but not the extra damage.
	
This maneuver is a supernatural ability.</p
