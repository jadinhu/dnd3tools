As though drawn straight from your imagination, the image you envision springs into existence.
You create an image or scene, which can incorporate not only sight but sound, smell, and thermal effects.
This effect functions in all respects like major image, except that the illusion is a pattern rather than a figment, and thus has a mind-affecting element to it.
Anyone who successfully disbelieves the illusion endures a mental backlash that deals 1d6 points of damage +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +15) and is dazed for 1 round.
A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the dazed effect.
