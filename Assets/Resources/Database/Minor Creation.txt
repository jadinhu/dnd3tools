You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable matter � ;linen clothes, a hemp rope, a wooden ladder, and so forth.
The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level.
You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to make a complex item, such as Craft (bowmaking) check to make straight arrow shafts.
