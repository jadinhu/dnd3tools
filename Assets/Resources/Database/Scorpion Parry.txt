Your keen eye and ability to discern a foe?s motives and intentions allow you to deflect an incoming attack into a different target. 
	
If an opponent attacks you, you can initiate this maneuver to make an opposed attack roll as an immediate action. If your foe?s result is higher, he attacks you as normal.
