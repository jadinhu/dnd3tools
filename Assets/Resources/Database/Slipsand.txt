This spell turns an area of natural sand into a pit of deadly slipsand (see page 25).
Supernatural sandlike materials, such as black sand or slumber sand, are not affected by the spell.
A creature unable to free itself from the slipsand immediately sinks to the bottom and must hold its breath or begin to suffocate.
If slipsand is cast on a structure of fused sand or on a sandy foundation, it causes the affected part (or more) of the structure to collapse.
If the spell is cast on a building's material, slipsand spreads out to fill the available space, possibly burying those within its area.
The collapsing structure is also dangerous (see Cave-ins and Collapses, page 66 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Slipsand creates a magic trap that is difficult to detect.
A character must succeed on a Survival check (DC equals the save DC of the spell) to notice a pit of slipsand.
Running or charging characters have no chance to detect the trap.
A rogue can find the trap with a successful Search check, but cannot disable it.
The DC is 25 + spell level, or 29 for slipsand.
Material Component: A pinch of slipsand.
