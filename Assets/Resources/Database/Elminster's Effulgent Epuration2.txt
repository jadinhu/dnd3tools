When you cast this spell, you bring forth one floating, silvery sphere per caster level, each about the size of your head.
These spheres hover around you to provide protection from magical effects.
As a standard action, you may shift the spell's effect (and thus all the spheres) to any other creature within range.
Each of these spheres can absorb and completely negate any spell or spell-like ability, regardless of level, that directly targets the subject.
The spheres do not automatically absorb all spells; the subject may choose whether or not to let them absorb any given spell cast upon it.
(This option allows the creature to benefit from helpful spells).
Area spells and spells that do not actually have a target (such as Bigby's interposing hand) cannot be absorbed.
Once a sphere has absorbed a spell or spell-like ability, it simply fades away.
Only spells and spell-like abilities of deific power can overcome the protection provided by Elminster's effulgent epuration.
