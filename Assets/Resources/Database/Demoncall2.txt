Your eyes roll back into your head as you call to Dagon for his unique insight.
Suddenly you become aware of some fragment of forbidden lore previously lost to you.
You tap into the forbidden knowledge of demons, gaining a +10 profane bonus on any one skill check involving Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (the planes), or Knowledge (religion).
The check must be made immediately, in the same turn as you cast the spell.
