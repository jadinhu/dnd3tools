The caster grows four long spider legs from the sides of her torso.
She can use these legs to move at a speed of 30 feet, no matter what the caster's normal speed is, as long as she carries less than her maximum load.
The caster can also use the extra legs to climb on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does, with her hands completely free.
The caster has a climb speed of 15 feet.
A creature with a Strength score of at least 20 +1 per caster level can pull the caster off a wall or ceiling.
