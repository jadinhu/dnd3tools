<b>You kneel next to your afflicted comrade and speak the soft words of this spell. At your touch a golden radiance infuses your companion.</b>
	
This spell channels positive energy into a creature to wipe away its afflictions. It immediately ends any of the following conditions affecting the subject: blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, and stunned. It negates sleep effects and the effect of the <b>feeblemind</b> spell, and ends any additional effects from poison, as the <b>neutralize poison</b> spell. It also cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
	
<b>Panacea</b> does not remove ability damage, negative levels, or drained levels.
	
Used against an undead creature, <b>panacea</b> deals damage instead of curing the creature (which takes half damage if it makes a Will saving throw), but it has no other effect.
