Your blood becomes suffused with the same energy type that powers your breath weapon.
(You must have a breath weapon that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to cast this spell).
Whenever you take damage from a natural or manufactured weapon, a spurt of blood erupts in a 5-footradius burst from the wound, dealing energy damage to creatures in its area.
The energy-charged blood deals a number of points of damage equal to your caster level.
When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy, it is a spell of that type.
For example, burning blood is an acid spell when you cast it to suffuse your blood with acid.
