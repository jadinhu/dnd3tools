The caster evokes pure evil power in the form of a black claw that flies at the target. If a ranged touch attack roll succeeds, the claw deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). On a critical hit, in addition to dealing double damage, the wound bleeds for 1 point of damage per round until it is magically healed.
