You create a shining silver breastplate around your body.
The armor is etched with a dragonscale pattern, an image of a silver dragon, or Torm's holy symbol (your choice when you cast the spell).
It is treated as +1 mithral breastplate for all purposes (including arcane spell failure chance), and you are treated as proficient with this armor.
Removing or destroying the armor dismisses the spell.
This spell has no effect if you are already wearing armor.
Torm the True is served by gold and silver dragons, and some of these dragons are the founders of ancient sorcerer bloodlines among the younger races.
If you are a sorcerer, the armor also gives you resistance to cold 5.
Focus: A silver piece and a piece of mithral in the shape of a dragonscale.
