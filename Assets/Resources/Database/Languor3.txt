<b>With a low thrumming sound, a blue beam lances from your finger to strike your foe and weaken him.</b>
	
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. This ray causes creatures it hits to become weak and slow for the spell's duration. A struck creature takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+10). In addition, a subject that fails a Will save is slowed.
	
The spell's slow effect counters and is countered by haste.
