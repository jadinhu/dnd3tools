This spell works identically to arcane lock, except that at the time of casting you may attune up to 1 individual per caster level to the object targeted by the spell.
These individuals (who need not be present during casting) can freely pass the improved arcane lock as if they had cast the spell.
Material Component: Gold dust worth 25 gp, plus 5 gp per individual attuned.
