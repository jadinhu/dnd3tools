This spell brings into being a shimmering, silver lancelike column of force, equivalent to a Large lance.
The lance flies toward a single creature you pantomime throwing it at when you cast the spell.
Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus and a +2 bonus for charging.
It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 20 and a critical multiplier of x3.
In addition, the creature struck must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the impact.
Focus: A miniature platinum lance engraved with arcane runes that costs 250 gp to construct.
