An invisible barrier surrounds a single creature and its equipment.
The target creature is impervious to most magical effects including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.
Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines, thus preventing the target from casting spells or using spell-like abilities or magic items for the duration.
An antimagic aura suppresses any spell or magical effect used on or by, or cast onto, the target, but does not dispel it.
A charmed creature, for example, is not charmed while affected by the aura, but the spell resumes functioning when antimagic aura ends.
Time spent within an antimagic aura counts against the suppressed spell's duration.
Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.
