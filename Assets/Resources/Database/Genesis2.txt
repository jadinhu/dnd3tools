You create an immobile, finite plane with limited access ï¿½ ;a demiplane.
Demiplanes created by this power are very small, minor planes.
You can cast this spell only on the Ethereal Plane.
When you cast it, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane.
At first, the demiplane grows at a rate of a 1-foot-radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as the fledgling plane draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter or astral ectoplasm.
You determine the environment in the demiplane when you first cast genesis, reflecting most any desire you can visualize.
You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the shape of the general terrain.
However, the spell cannot create life (such as vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth).
If you want these benefits, you must add them in some other fashion.
Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, you can continue to cast this spell to enlarge your demiplane if you are inside the boundaries of the demiplane.
In such a case, the radius of the demiplane increases by 60 feet for each subsequent casting.
If you cast the spell again while you are outside an existing demiplane, the casting creates a separate bubble that does not touch or overlap any previously created demiplane.
XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
(Note: This version of the genesis spell supersedes the genesis spell description previously published in Defenders of the Faith).
