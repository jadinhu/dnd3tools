<b>You toss the bit of earth against the wall and it glitters and burns as it strikes the stone. The rock vaporizes where it hits and a passage opens before you, burrowing into the wall.</b>
	
As with <b>passwall</b> (<b>PH</b> 259), this spell allows you to create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or harder materials, if a wall's thickness is more than 1 foot per caster level, then a single <b>excavate</b> spell simply makes a niche or short tunnel with the stated dimensions. Several <b>excavate</b> spells can be used in succession to breach very thick walls by forming a continuing passage. Unlike <b>passwall</b>, <b>excavate</b> is an instantaneous effect that does not end and cannot be dispelled; any passage it creates is permanent.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A pinch of excavated earth.
