This spell conjures a ring of swirling metal blades around you.
The ring extends 5 feet from you, into all squares adjacent to your space.

The blades conjured by a lawful-aligned cleric are cold iron, those conjured by a chaotic-aligned cleric are silver, and those conjured by cleric who is neither lawful nor chaotic are steel.
