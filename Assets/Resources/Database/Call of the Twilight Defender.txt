The very ground erupts in a shower of stone and dirt, accompanied by a thunderclap.
Standing in the center of the damaged ground is a creature of stone, wood, and plant parts resembling the regal form of a guardian dragon.
This spell summons one twilight guardian (see page 121) to fight for you.
The spell functions like a summon nature's ally spell, but with one exception.
At any time, a summoned twilight guardian can sacrifice itself by simply touching you (a standard action); the twilight guardian is immediately destroyed, and you gain a number of hit points equal to 1/2 the twilight guardian's remaining hit points before its sacrifice.
Special: A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.
