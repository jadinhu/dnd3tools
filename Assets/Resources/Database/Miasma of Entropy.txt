Miasma of entropy causes accelerated decay in all wood, leather, and other natural materials in the spell's area.
It destroys nonmagical objects of wood, leather, paper, and other formerly living organic matter.
All such objects within the area rot into slimy, pulpy masses.
Objects weighing more than 1 pound per caster level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are ruined.
Alternatively, you can target miasma of entropy against a single solid object of nonliving organic matter that weighs up to 10 pounds per caster level.
When targeted against an animated object made of an organic material, miasma of entropy deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.
