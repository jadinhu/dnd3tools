You mantle yourself in a powerful magical field that facilitates your defense against enemy spells.
While a duelward is in effect, counterspelling is an immediate action for you, allowing you to counterspell even when it is not your turn without having previously readied an action.
You also gain a +4 competence bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify spells being cast.
The first time you successfully counterspell while the spell is in effect (whether you counterspell as an immediate action or not), duelward is discharged.
Material Component: A miniature silk glove.
