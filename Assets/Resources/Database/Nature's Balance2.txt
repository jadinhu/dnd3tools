You lend some of your ability score points to your target.
You take a -4 penalty to any single ability score of your choice, and your target gains an equivalent enhancement bonus to the same ability score.
You get no saving throw to avoid the loss, but your target may attempt a Fortitude save to avoid the gain, if desired.
If you cast this spell a second time within 1 hour, you take 2d10 points of damage in addition to the normal effect.
