When you step into a portal affected by this spell, you can wait for a short time within an extradimensional space between the portal's entrance and exit.
This spell only works on a portal you are able to activate; for example, if you are an elf and the target portal doesn't work for elves, you can't use this spell on the portal.
The extradimensional space created by this spell is similar to that created by a rope trick spell but can only hold you and your gear (up to your maximum heavy load).
When the spell ends, you exit the portal at either your point of entry or the portal's destination.
While within this extradimensional space, you can see the origin and destination locations, though the images are blurry (much like viewing the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane).
Dispel magic or gate seal traps you within the extradimensional space for as long as the portal is negated or sealed (as would surrounding both ends with a dead magic area).
Mordenkainen's disjunction or some other effect that destroys a portal outright forcibly ejects you from one random end of the portal and deals 5d6 points of damage to you.
This spell originated in Shaundakul's church and is hard to
find elsewhere.
Arcane Material Component: A silver wire tied in a knot.
