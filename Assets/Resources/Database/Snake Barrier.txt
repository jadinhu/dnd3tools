This spell creates an invisible barrier that prevents reptiles, reptilian creatures, and dragons from crossing it.
Affected creatures are aware of the barrier's presence and purpose, and reptiles that are not overtly hostile avoid the barrier and those protected by it.
Reptilian creatures with hostile intent may try to penetrate the barrier.
Affected creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice must make a successful Will saving throw to cross at all.
Any affected creature that crosses the barrier takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), with a successful Fortitude saving throw reducing the damage by half.
Intelligent reptilian creatures that encounter the barrier usually find it infuriating, and are much less likely to befriend and aid the caster.
Material Component: A shed snakeskin.
