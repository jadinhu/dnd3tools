This spell temporarily bestows the aura of celestial authority on you, inspiring awe in all lesser creatures who behold your terrible perfection and righteousness.
Creatures with fewer than 8 levels or Hit Dice cease whatever they are doing and turn to face you.
When you speak, your words are treated as a suggestion spell, and the listeners telepathically understand you, even if they do not understand your language.
Creatures who make successful saving throws are not awed by you and can continue their actions normally.
Creatures with more than 8 HD are immune to the effect of the spell.
