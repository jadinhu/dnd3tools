You create up to one mass of flame per level to explode upon the battlefield.
Each mass of flame is treated as a 5-foot-radius burst and deals 1d6 points of fire damage/level (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within the area.
The bursts do not need to be contiguous, and may be distributed within range as you see fit.
Burst effects that overlap do not inflict additional damage.
Material Component: A flask of alchemist's fire.
