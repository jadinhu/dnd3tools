Blood seems to pour from your eyes as an irregular red glow whirls around you chaotically.
This spell imbues you with a supernatural ferocity, giving you an edge in melee combat.
You gain a morale bonus on your melee damage rolls (with weapons or natural attacks) equal to 1/2 your caster level.
This has no impact on your ability to cast spells or perform other actions.
Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a true strike effect (as the spell) on yourself as a standard action.
This effect lasts for the normal duration of the true strike spell (a single attack), after which the entire spell's duration ends.
Special: if you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), you cast this spell at +1 caster level.
