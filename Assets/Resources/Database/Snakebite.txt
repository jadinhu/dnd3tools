One of your arms turns into a venomous snake with a fanged, biting mouth.
The bite does 1d3 points of damage and carries a toxic venom (1d6 Con/1d6 Con).
Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half caster level + caster's Wisdom modifier).
If the victim fails either save, he must also make a Will save (DC as normal for spell) or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.
You can't hold a weapon with your transformed hand, but your other hand can be used to wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components.
Attacking with the transformed hand and a weapon incurs the standard two-weapon fighting penalties (see Table 8-2: Two-Weapon Fighting Penalties, page 125 of the Player's Handbook).
You can only be under the effect of one snakebite spell at any given time.
