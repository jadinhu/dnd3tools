You restore a semblance of life to a deceased creature.
You can reanimate creatures that have been dead up to one day per caster level.
In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return (see Bringing Back the Dead in the Player's Handbook).
If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.
This spell cannot fully bind the soul back into the body, and the reanimated subject is in a state of half-life ï¿½ ;neither dead nor fully alive.
The reanimated creature has 1 hit point and can take only a single move-equivalent action each round.
It cannot attack, use spells, or activate magic items.
It can speak (if it could while fully alive), but its speech is slow and slurred.
The creature's memory is cloudy and confused, and it has trouble remembering even the basic details of its past life and friends.
If left unwatched, the creature is prone to wander off randomly with no conception of where it is going or where it has been.
If wounded again, the creature can be healed, but cannot rise above 1 hit point.
It can gain temporary hit points, but cannot increase its hit point total through Constitution increase or any other means.
The creature can be killed again (and reanimated again), and it can be restored to full life through any spell that would restore a fully dead creature to life (such as raise dead).
As with gentle repose, time spent reanimated does not count against the time limit on raising the creature from the dead.
The body does not decay while it is reanimated.
A reanimated creature is not undead, and cannot be turned, harmed by positive energy or holy water, or healed by negative energy.
A greater restoration spell fully restores the creature's memory but does not improve its physical state.
