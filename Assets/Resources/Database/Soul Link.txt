You draw forth a scrap of parchment and speak the name written on it in blood.
The parchment turns to dust as you touch the targeted creature with you other hand, creating a potent link between the two of you.
You can use a soul link to monitor the subject's condition and location, as though it were affected by a status spell.
You and the subject can also communicate telepathically as long as you are both on the same plane.
By concentrating, you can also use scrying upon the subject, which is permitted no saving throw to resist.
In addition, the subject takes a -4 penalty on any saving throw made to resist a mind-affecting spell or ability you use against it.
At the time the spell is cast, you can choose to take a -2 penalty to one of your ability scores in order to grant the subject a +2 enhancement bonus to that same ability score.
If you use this option, the subject chooses the ability score affected for both of you and takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the effects of this spell.
You can have only one soul link in effect at a time.
If you cast this spell a second time, the soul link already active ends immediately, regardless of the outcome of the second casting.
Material Component: A piece of parchment with the target's name (or detailed physical description) written upon it in your own blood.
