Like shield other, this spell wards the subjects, creating a mystic connection between them and you so that some of their wounds are transferred to you.
The subjects each gain a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves.
All the subjects take only half damage from all wounds and attacks that deal them hit point damage.
The amount of damage not taken by all the warded
creatures is taken by you.
Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and disintegration, are not affected.
If a subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage.
When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subjects, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subjects.
If you die while this spell is in effect, the spell ends in a burst of positive energy that restores 1d8 hit points to each subject.
If a subject moves out of range of the spell, that subject's connection to you is severed but the spell continues as long as there is at least one subject remaining and you remain alive.
Focus: A platinum ring (worth at least 50 gp) worn by you and each subject of the spell.
