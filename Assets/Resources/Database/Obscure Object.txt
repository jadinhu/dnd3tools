This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying) effects, such as the scrying spell or a crystal ball.
Such an attempt automatically fails (if the divination is targeted on the object) or fails to perceive the object (if the divination is targeted on a nearby location, object, or person).
Arcane Material Component: A piece of chameleon skin.
