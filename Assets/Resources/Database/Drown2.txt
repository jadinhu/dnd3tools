You create water in the lungs of the subject, which begins to drown.
The subject immediately falls unconscious, dropping to 0 hp.
In the following round, it drops to -1 hit points and is dying.
In the following round, it dies.
(For details, see The Drowning Rule, page 85 of the <span class="caps">DUNGEON</span> MASTER's Guide).
Coughing and other attempts by the victim to physically expel the water are useless.
However, any time before death it can be stabilized with a Heal check (DC 15).
Undead, constructs, creatures who do not need to breathe, and creatures who can breathe water are unaffected by this spell.
