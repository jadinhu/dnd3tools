You summon forth a column of green slime that quickly flattens out over a circular area 30 feet in diameter.
You create a wave of green slime that begins at the location you choose (within range) and violently spreads to the limit of the area.
The wave splashes and splatters as it moves, clinging to the walls and ceilings of enclosed areas as well as the floor.
In addition, one patch of green slime adheres to each creature in the area for every 5 feet of its face.
Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact and even dissolves metal.
A patch of green slime deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage per round that it is in contact with flesh.
Against wood or metal, green slime deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignoring the hardness of metal but not that of wood.
It does not harm stone.
On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away ï¿½ ;processes that damage the victim as well as the slime.
Extreme cold or heat, sunlight, or a remove disease spell destroys the green slime.
Unlike normal green slime, the slime created by this spell evaporates at the end of the spell's duration.
Material Component: A few drops of stagnant pond water.
