The affected creature sprouts a black, scorpionlike tail. As a free action each round, the target creature may attack any adjacent foe with the tail's stinger, using its full melee attack bonus and dealing 2d6 points of piercing damage (plus Strength modifier) on a successful hit. The tail is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction; any creature wounded by the stinger must succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.
