A cone of fiery white moonlight springs from your hand.
Living creatures in the area feel an unnatural chill and take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels, to a maximum of 10d8.
Undead and shapechangers take double damage.
This application of the spell allows a Reflex save for half damage.
All magical auras within the cone glow with a faint blue light for 1 round per caster level.
Disguised, shapechanged, or polymorphed creatures and objects in the spell's area at the time the spell is cast must make Will saves or immediately return to their normal forms.
Even if the save succeeds, they remain covered in ghostly white outlines that show their true forms for 1 round per caster level.
The entire area covered by the cone glows silver white for 1 round per caster level.
This radiance is as bright as the light of a full moon and negates electricity for 1 round per caster level unless the creature generating it makes a caster level check against a DC equal to the caster's level.
If an electricity effect is generated outside the glowing cone, the cone blocks the electricity effect if the caster level check fails.
If an electricity effect is generated inside the glowing cone, the cone completely negates the electricity effect if the caster level check fails.
