You create a small domed snow house with a single entrance passage.
Up to one Large or threeMedium or twelve Small creatures can fit into the igloo with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it.
The temperature inside the igloo is magically warm, at exactly 50Â° F, and the walls do not melt.
The igloo has two features that help arctic survival: a sleeping platform and a lamp.
The snow sleeping platform takes advantage of the warm air trapped below the low roof, generated by body heat and a stone lamp.
The magical smokeless lamp provides heat for comfort and for cooking.
The igloo also provides protection against the elements, such as wind, snow, and hail.
The igloo withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
The loose-packed snow of the igloo has a hardness of 0, and 3 hp per inch of thickness.
Material Component: A small dollop of seal fat or caribou fat.</p
