An orb of acid about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target.
A creature struck by the orb takes damage and becomes sickened by the acid's noxious fumes for 1 round.
A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect but does not reduce the damage.
