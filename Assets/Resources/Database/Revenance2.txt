You touch a recently slain ally and temporarily restore the character to life so he may continue to fight.
The target can have been dead for up to 1 round/caster level.
He functions as if a raise dead spell had been cast upon him, except that she does not lose a level and has half of his normal hit points.
He is alive (not undead) for the duration of the spell and can be healed normally, but dies as soon as the spell ends.
While the subject is under this spell, he is not affected by resurrection or raise dead.
The target gains a +1 morale bonus on attacks, damage, saves, and checks against the creature that killed him.
Material Component: 500 gp of diamond dust sprinkled over the body.
