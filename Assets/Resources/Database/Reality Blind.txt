This spell overwhelms the target with hallucinations, causing him to be blinded and stunned if he fails the save.
The subject can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the spell.
Even after the subject succeeds at the save or the caster stops concentrating, the subject is plagued with nightmares every night.
The nightmares prevent the subject from benefiting from natural healing.
These nightmares continue until the caster dies or the subject succeeds at a Will saving throw, attempted once per night.
This nightmare effect is treated as a curse and thus cannot be dispelled.
It is subject to remove curse, however.
Material Component: A 2-inch-diameter multicolored disk of paper or ribbon.
