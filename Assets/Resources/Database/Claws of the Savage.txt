The caster grants one creature two long claws that replace its hands, tentacle tips, or whatever else is appropriate.
The claws deal damage based on the creature's size.
The creature can make attacks with both claws as if it were proficient with them.
Just as with a creature that has natural weapons, the subject takes no penalty for making two claw attacks.
The subject is treated as armed.
Furthermore, these claws gain a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls.
If the creature already has claws, those claws gain a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and the claws' damage increases as if the creature were two size categories larger.
