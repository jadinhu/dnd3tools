With the final word of the spell, your chosen foe is wracked with such pain that it doubles over and collapses.
Its face and hands blister and drip fluid, and its eyes cloud with blood, rendering it blind.
Your touch causes your target to experience excruciating pain.
For the duration of the spell, the subject falls prone and is blinded and helpless.
Even when the spell ends, the subject is still shaken for 3d10 minutes.
