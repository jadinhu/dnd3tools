A dull humming noise sounds briefly, and the air crackles with the terrible power of an orthon.
While under the effect of this spell, a creature is infused with the disruptive power of an orthon.
As an immediate action, the subject of this spell can erect a 20-foot-radius field that disrupts teleportation spells or effects.
All creatures in the area are prevented from using any spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that provides such movement, as if they were in the area of a dimensional lock spell.
Each use of this field lasts 1 round.
In addition, the subject of the spell gains the benefit of a sonic shield for as long as the spell remains in effect.
This shield functions like the fire shield spell, except that it deals sonic damage instead of cold or fire, and the subject takes half damage from acid-based attacks.
If exposed to an acid attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, the subject takes no damage on a successful save.
The subject gains resistance to fire 10.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the orthon).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.
Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.
