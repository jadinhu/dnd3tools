This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods.
The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process.
Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.
The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy
substance.
Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available.
(For example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a corpse).
You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.
Material Component: A pinch of earth and a drop of blood.
