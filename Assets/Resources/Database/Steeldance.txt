You cause two daggers in your possession to grow to the size and shape of longswords, which then attack creatures you specify.
The blades have AC 14 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +2 natural), hardness 10, and 5 hit points.
They fly at speed 30 feet (good maneuverability), deal 1d8 points of slashing damage, and score a threat of a critical on a natural 19 or 20.
They are otherwise treated as Medium-size animated objects (as if animated by an animate objects spell).
You can cast spells such as magic weapon on the daggers before or after the steeldance spell takes effect.
Focus: Two daggers.
