<b>Your stomach growls as you near completion of the spell. As you declare the target of the spell, your hunger disappears, but you note with satisfaction that your target seems wracked with pain.</b>
	
You inflict wracking hunger pangs on the target creature. It must make a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and become fatigued. A creature that makes a successful save takes half damage and is not fatigued by the spell.
	
A fatigued creature becomes exhausted when doing anything that causes the creature to become fatigued (such as dangerous environmental temperatures or ending a barbarian rage). A fatigued creature that fails its saving throw against starvation takes nonlethal damage as normal and becomes exhausted. 
	
Material Component: A piece of spoiled food.
