This spell causes humanoids of Medium-size or smaller within the area to freeze in place, standing helpless as if affected by the hold person spell.
When casting the spell, you must specify some condition that must be met to release the victims ï¿½ ;&quot;Wait here until I return&quot;, or &quot;Stay here for all eternity!&quot; for example.
You may specify any condition, however implausible, but the spell ends as soon as that condition is met.
For every hour the creatures are transfixed, they can attempt another saving throw.
The spell affects an area, not (directly) the creatures in it, so creatures that are removed from the area are freed from the spell's effects, and humanoids of Medium-size or smaller that enter the area must make a successful saving throw or become transfixed.
If all affected creatures are freed from the spell, the spell ends and additional creatures entering the area are not affected.
Material Component: A drop of pine resin.
