Green-tinged smoke billows from the earth, obscuring sight and burning all it touches.
You create a bank of smoke, similar in effect to a fog cloud.
In addition to obscuring sight, the cloud deals 1d6 points of acid damage per round to all creatures within.
Furthermore, its acrid fumes burn the eyes, imposing a -5 penalty on all attack rolls and Search and Spot checks unless a creature succeeds on a Fortitude save (repeated each round the creature is within the cloud).
These penalties last as long as the subject remains within the cloud, plus an additional 2 rounds thereafter.
If a creature within the cloud takes acid damage from any other effect, it must succeed on a Fortitude save (using this spell's save DC) or be blinded for 1 round.
