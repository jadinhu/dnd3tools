This spell helps you elude pursuers by causing them to run down blind alleys, make wrong turns at intersections, and
bypass obvious directional indicators during a chase.
Any pursuer who loses sight of you and fails a Will save has a 50% chance of making a wrong turn or heading in the wrong direction, even in the face of physical evidence (such as a dangling rope or an open door) as to your true path.
Material Component: A fox's tail.
