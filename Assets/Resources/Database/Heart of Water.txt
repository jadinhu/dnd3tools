The crashing of waves echoes in your ears.
This spell converts part of your body into elemental water, which makes you better able to navigate aquatic environments and slip through confined spaces.
You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed, which grants you certain benefits (including a +8 racial bonus on
Swim checks; see MM 311).
You also gain the ability to breathe water (as if under the effect of a water breathing spell).
Finally, you gain a +5 enhancement bonus on Escape Artist checks.
Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a freedom of movement effect (as the spell) on yourself as a swift action.
This benefit lasts for 1 round per level, at the end of which time the spell's entire effect ends.
If heart of water is active on you at the same time as heart of air, heart of earth, or heart of fire, you gain light fortification.
If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you become immune to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.
