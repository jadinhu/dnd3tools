A green ray stabs from your pointing finger.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to affect a target.
A subject that is successfully targeted must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for the duration of the spell.
A subject of the ray that succeeds on its Fortitude save is instead sickened.
A neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench.
Material Component: A small scrap of cloth taken from clothing worn by a ghoul, or a pinch of earth from a ghoul's lair.
