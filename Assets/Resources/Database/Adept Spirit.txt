You bestow the soul of a great ancient spellcaster on the creature touched, giving him great skill with magic.
As an immediate action, the target creature can activate the adept spirit.
While active, the spirit's wisdom and learning provide the recipient of the spell with a +1 insight bonus to caster level and a +2 insight bonus on Will saves, Concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks.
The adept spirit remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends.
No creature can be the target of more than one adept spirit spell simultaneously.
If a second is cast before the first has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect.
Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus on Will saves, Concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks provided by the spirit improves by 1.
(The bonus to caster level is not improved by essentia investment).
