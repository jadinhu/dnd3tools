<b>Enrage animal</b> affects only creatures of the animal type and bestows a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a ï¿½ ;2 penalty to Armor Class. This effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's rage (<b>PH</b> 25), except that the animal is not fatigued at the end of the rage.
