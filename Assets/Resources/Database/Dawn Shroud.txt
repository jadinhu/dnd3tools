You cause the target to glow with the rosy light of the dawn.
In addition to acting as a daylight spell, the light is harmful to oozes and undead.
When the spell is cast, and at the beginning of each of your
turns thereafter, such creatures take 1d6 points of damage if within the bright light of the spell (out to 60 feet) or 1 point of damage per round if within the shadowy illumination of the spell (more than 60 feet, out to 120 feet).
If the subject is touched by such a creature using a touch attack, or if it hits the subject with a natural weapon or unarmed strike, it takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum 1d6+15), with a Will saving throw for half damage.
If you cast this spell on yourself, you can suppress or restore this light as a free action once each round.
This spell was created by clerics of the church of Lathander, but they do not try to restrict its use to only those of their faith.
