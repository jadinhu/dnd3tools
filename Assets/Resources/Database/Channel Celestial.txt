You invite a celestial creature to occupy your body, as described in the section on Celestial Channeling in Chapter 2.
The celestial must be present when you cast the spell, it must be willing, and it cannot have more than 12 HD.
It need not have the innate spell-like ability to channel its power through mortals; this spell bestows that ability upon the celestial.
If you channel a celestial that was summoned to the Material Plane by means of a summon monster or similar spell, the channeling ends when the duration of the summoning spell ends, regardless of any remaining duration on the channel celestial spell.
Abstinence Component: You must abstain from intoxicants and stimulants for 24 hours before casting this spell.
You must not be the subject of any other spell at the time you cast this spell.
You must not be suffering from any ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain at the time you cast this spell, including the effects of any previously cast sanctified spell.
Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Strength and Dexterity damage.
