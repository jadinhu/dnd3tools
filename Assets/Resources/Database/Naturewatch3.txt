<b>Reaching out with your heart, you seek knowledge of the health of plants and animals in the area.</b>
	
This spell is similar to <b>deathwatch</b> (PH 217), but it functions only on animals and plants. In addition, it also allows you to determine a variety of other mundane information about the animals and plants (whether or not the plants are dehydrated, the animals are malnourished, and so forth).
