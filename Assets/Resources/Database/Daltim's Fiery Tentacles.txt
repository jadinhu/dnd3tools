<b>Daltim's Fiery Tentacles</b>(Shining South)

Conjuration (Creation) [Fire]
 <b>Level:</b>  Sorcerer 5,  Wizard 5,    
<b>Components:</b>
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> None and Reflex half; see text

 	
This spell functions similarly to Evard's black tentacles, except that the tentacles are limned in blue-white fire.
Every creature within the area of the spell takes 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15 points) each round.
A successful Reflex save halves this damage, but a character grappled by the tentacles cannot make the save.
