You give the subject creature a brief vision of a divine entity that is giving it support and inspiring it to continue. The creature gets a morale bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on a single saving throw. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies. Using the bonus discharges the spell.
