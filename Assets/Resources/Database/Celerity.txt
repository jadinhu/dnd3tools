<b>Celerity</b>(Player's Handbook II)

Transmutation
 <b>Level:</b>  Bard 4,  Sorcerer 4,  Wizard 4,    
<b>Components:</b>

 	
This spell works like lesser celerity, except that you pull even more time into the present.
When you cast this spell, you can immediately take a standard action, as if you had readied an action.
You can even interrupt another creature's turn when you cast this spell.
However, after you take the standard action granted by this spell, you are dazed until the end of your next turn.
