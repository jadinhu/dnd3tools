You cause a living creature to experience the effects of heatstroke.
The target takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.
If the target fails a Fortitude save, it immediately becomes fatigued, or exhausted if already fatigued.
Since this spell causes heatstroke, the damage and fatigue dealt can only be healed after that condition is treated properly (see page 13).
