Black flames flicker over a corpse, utterly consuming it.
You destroy the remains of a dead person or creature, preventing any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse.
There is a 50% chance that a wish,miracle, or true resurrection spell cannot restore to life a victim consumed by a barghest's feast spell.
Check once for each destroyed creature.
If the d% roll fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.
Material Component: A diamond worth 5,000 gp.
