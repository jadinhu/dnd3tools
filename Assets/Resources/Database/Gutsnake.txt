Transmutation
 <b>Level:</b>  Sorcerer 4,  Wizard 4,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, AF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action
 <b>Range:</b> Personal
 <b>Effect:</b> One magical snakelike tentacle
 <b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)

 	
You sprout a 15-foot-long tentacle from your stomach that can attack enemies.
The tentacle has no eyes but ends in a pair of snapping reptilian jaws.
The tentacle is equivalent to a giant constrictor snake except that it is completely obedient to you and moves as you command it.
Attacks against the tentacle cause you no discomfort and do not disrupt your spellcasting.
If &quot;killed&quot;, the tentacle disappears without causing harm to you.
The tentacle does not interfere with spellcasting in any way.
As a free action on your turn, you may have the tentacle attack (as a giant constrictor), and if it successfully hits, it can constrict.
Each round the gutsnake is constricting a target, you may not move more than 5 feet away from the target, unless you are strong enough to drag it with you.
This is the only way in which the tentacle restricts movement.
While the snake is present, you may use its Balance and Climb skill modifiers instead of your own.
Focus: A fang from any reptile.
