You radiate an energy that gently pushes plants aside, allowing easy passage and hiding your trail after you pass.
Anyone in the area of the spell (including you) finds the undergrowth held aside while she passes.
This effect essentially provides a trail through any kind of undergrowth, reducing any movement penalties from terrain caused by dense vegetation (see Table 9-5: Terrain and Overland Movement, page 164 of the Player's Handbook).
Once the effect of the spell passes, the plants return to their normal shape.
The DC to track anyone who traveled within the area of this spell increases by 5 (the equivalent of hiding the trail).
This spell has no effect on plant creatures (that is, they aren't pushed or held aside by its effect).
