You create an intangible image of a floating skull that trails black flames.
The skull and its flames are illusory, so they neither deal damage nor take damage from attacks.
The skull has a fly speed of 40 feet (perfect), but it cannot move more than 20 feet from its point of origin.
It simply floats about aimlessly but threateningly within its available space until the spell is discharged.
Upon casting this spell, you set two triggering conditions for the skull.
The first activates a message that the skull delivers as if it were a magic mouth.
The second causes the skull to spit a line of flame 10 feet long that deals 1d8 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) at the creature that triggered it.
A target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage.
Anyone failing this save must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be dazed for 1 round.
The triggering conditions for the two effects can be
different, or they can be the same.
In the latter case, the skull would spit flame and speak its message at the same time.
Once the triggering conditions for both effects have been met, the skull disappears.
The skull can produce each effect only once, so if it has already spoken its message, it does not speak it again even if the message trigger occurs a second time.
