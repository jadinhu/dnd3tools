A beam of sickly gray energy strikes the target of this spell.
He acquires an ashen tone to his skin.
With each passing moment, the grayish tone becomes deeper in color as the target transforms into a stone statue.
This spell slowly transforms a creature into an inanimate stone statue.
The target must make a Fortitude save each round for the duration of spell at the start of its turn or take a cumulative 10-foot penalty to speed and a -2 penalty to Dexterity.
If the target's speed drops to 0 feet, it cannot move.
If the target fails four or more saves, it permanently transforms into a statue as if affected by flesh to stone.
Any effect or spell that reverses flesh to stone also cures this condition.
