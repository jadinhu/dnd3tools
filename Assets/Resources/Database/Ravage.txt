A terrible column of swirling black energy engulfs creatures and rips at their bodies and souls.
All living creatures within the spell's area take 1d6 points of vile damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6).
Unlike regular damage, vile damage can only be healed by magic cast within the area of a consecrate or hallow spell.
