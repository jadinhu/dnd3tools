You change the sounds that creatures or objects make.
You can create sounds where none exist (such as making trees sing), deaden sounds (such as making a party of adventurers silent), or transform sounds into other sounds (such as making a caster's voice sound like a pig snorting).
All affected creatures or objects must be transmuted in the same way.
Once the transmutation is made, you cannot change it.
You can change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words with which you are unfamiliar yourself.
For instance, you can't change your voice so that it sounds as though you are giving the command word to activate a magic item unless you know that command word.
A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically (such as into that of the aforementioned snorting pig) is unable to cast spells with verbal components.
