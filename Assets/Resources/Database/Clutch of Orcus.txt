The caster creates a magical force that grips the subject's heart (or similar vital organ) and begins crushing it.
The victim is paralyzed (as if having a heart attack) and takes 1d3 points of damage per round.
Each round, the caster must concentrate to maintain the spell.
In addition, a conscious victim gains a new saving throw each round to stop the spell.
If the victim dies as a result of this spell, his chest ruptures and bursts, and his smoking heart appears in the caster's hand.
