With a touch of your hand, you boost the subject's life energy, granting him or her the fast healing ability for the duration of the spell.
This healing applies only to damage sustained during the spell's duration, not to that from previous injuries.
The subject heals 1 hit point per round of such damage until the spell ends and is automatically stabilized it he or she begins dying from hit point loss during that time.
Regenerate light wounds does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow or attach lost body parts.
The effects of multiple regenerate spells do not stack, only the highest-level effect applies.
Applying a second regenerate spell of equal level extends the first spells duration by the full duration of the second spell.
