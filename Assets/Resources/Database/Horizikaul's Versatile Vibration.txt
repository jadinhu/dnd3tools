You create a cone of powerful sound that can be used to attack or move objects or creatures.
If used to attack, the cone inflicts 1 point of sonic damage per two levels each round a creature is within the area; a successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half.
If used to move objects or creatures, it functions as the sustained force version of telekinesis, although you can only move objects away from you.
Targets within the effect of a silence spell cannot be moved.
The spell's sound is a sustained hum as loud as a battle.
Focus: A hollow cone of brass and gold worth 50 gp.
