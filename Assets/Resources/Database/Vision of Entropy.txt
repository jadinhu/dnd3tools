With a whisper and wave of your hand, you invite the targeted creature to behold the seething chaos of the infinite void surrounding the Abyss.
Each round, the subject must make a successful Will save or be overwhelmed with madness and awe at the sight of the images of the Abyss forming in its mind.
The subject becomes shaken on the first failure, frightened on the second, panicked on the third, and unconscious on the fourth.
A creature that faints from the effect of this spell remains unconscious for 1 hour or until revived.
Any successful saving throw merely spares the subject the effect of the next failure for that round; any already existing condition persists until the next failure changes it or until the spell ends.
