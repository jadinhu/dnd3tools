With this spell, you place a magic trap on any object that casts a shadow.
If the object is disturbed in any way that causes its shadow to shift (for instance, if it or a nearby light source is moved), a bound greater shadow (see Monster Manual page 221) emerges from the object's shadow to attack the nearest living creature.
The shadow can be turned or destroyed as normal; otherwise, it remains for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.
If the trapped object resides in a place that has no shadows, the trap does not trigger, although the spell remains in effect.
Material Component: A sheet of black cloth large enough to drape over the warded object.
