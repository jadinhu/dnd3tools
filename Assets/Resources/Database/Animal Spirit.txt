You bestow a small portion of the soul-energy of the animal kingdom on the creature touched, granting him some of an animal's sensory capabilities.
As an immediate action, the target creature can activate the animal spirit.
While active, the spirit's keen senses provide the recipient of the spell with low-light vision and scent, as well as a +2 insight bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks.
The animal spirit remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends.
No creature can be the target of more than one animal spirit spell simultaneously.
If a second is cast before the first has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect.
Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks provided by the spirit improves by 2.
