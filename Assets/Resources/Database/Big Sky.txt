This spell creates the sensation that the sky is filled with invisible nature spirits and sussurating voices.
This effect is a boon to you and your allies and a bane to your enemies.
You gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects for the duration of the spell, as does each of your allies within the area.
Each of your enemies within the area who fails a Will save behaves as if affected by a fear spell.
Each round, every affected enemy gets a new Will save to shake off the effects of this spell.
An enemy who makes a successful save need not make any more saving throws for the duration of the spell.
Creatures immune to fear are immune to both aspects of this spell.
