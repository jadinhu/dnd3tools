With a cacophony of shrieks and squeals, a horde of flying, running, and crawling pests appears from the shadows and swarms across your foes.
Summon pest swarm creates a horde of small mammals, birds, and vermin that appear throughout the target area, tear into any creature present, then move in a crawling mass at your volition.
The pest swarm (see page 136) stays in one place unless you actively direct it (a move action for you).
If the pest swarm moves beyond the spell's range, it disappears.
It takes actions at the beginning of your turn.
The pest swarm attacks any creature other than you that occupies all or part of its space.
Arcane Material Component: A handful of teeth, claws, and mandibles from urban pests (such as crows, rats, cats, and cockroaches).
