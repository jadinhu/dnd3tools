Your eyes briefly flash with brilliant light, opening your mind to encompass every object nearby.
You gain great vision, allowing you to see everything in the surrounding area clearly.
You gain a +10 insight bonus on Spot checks and immunity to being dazzled or blinded (if you are already dazzled or blinded, you can see normally for the duration of the spell).
Additionally, if you cast this while under the effect of see invisibility, true seeing, or any other spell that allows you to see invisible creatures, you can activate a faerie fire effect (as the spell) on any invisible creature or object within 60 feet as a swift action.
Doing this ends the duration of vision of the omniscient eye;
the faerie fire effect lasts for 1 minute.
Special: A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on Spot checks.
