<b>Through focus, raw power, and expert aim, you make a mighty attack against your foe, leaving him temporarily knocked senseless by your attack.</b>
	
The proper application of force to just the right part of a foe?s anatomy allows you to disrupt his actions. While he stumbles back, senseless, you press the advantage.
	
You make a single melee attack as part of this strike. If this attack hits, the target takes melee damage normally and must make a Fortitude save (DC 15 + your Str modifier) or be dazed for 1 round.</p
