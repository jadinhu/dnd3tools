A ghostly hand bearing a lit candle appears at the spot you choose, shedding light in a 5-foot radius and moving as you desire ï¿½ ;forward or back, up or down, straight or around corners at up to 50 feet per round (no concentration required).
The hand and candle are incorporeal and can pass through objects, making them a useful tool for simulating hauntings.
As well, a corpse candle illuminates hidden, ethereal, and invisible beings and items, all of which become faintly visible as wispy outlines.
Ethereal creatures remain unreachable from the Material Plane (except with force effects), but invisible creatures have only concealment (20% miss chance) and lose their bonus on attack rolls from invisibility when they are within 5 feet of the candle.
The ghostly radiance also makes immaterial creatures and items slightly material, so that incorporeal creatures within 5 feet of a corpse candle have only a 30% chance to avoid damage from corporeal creatures (though all other benefits of being incorporeal are retained).
The hand is Diminutive, has 1 hit point per caster level, and has AC 14 + a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.
It makes saves as you do but is immune to spells that don't cause damage.
The spell effect ends if the hand is destroyed, and the hand winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.
Material Component: A piece of a corpse untreated by any kind of preservative.
