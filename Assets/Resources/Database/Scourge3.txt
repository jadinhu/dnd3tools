<b>Scourge</b>(Spell Compendium, p. 181)

Necromancy
 <b>Level:</b>   Pestilence 7,   
<b>Components:</b>V, S, AF, DF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
 <b>Target:</b> One creature/2 levels, no two of which are more than 50 ft. apart
 <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes

 	
<b>Picking out those you wish revenge upon, you cause their bodies to erupt in painful and debilitating blackened boils, magenta blotches, violet lesions, seeping abscesses, and malignant cysts.</b>
	
The target creatures are infected with a vile disease unless they succeed on a Fortitude save. Once it has infected a creature, the disease immediately deals 1d6 points of Strength and Dexterity damage, and it deals the same damage each subsequent day. A creature is allowed an additional saving throw each day to avoid that day's damage. As with mummy rot (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 292), successful saves do not allow the creature to recover. The symptoms persist until the creature finds some magical means to remove the disease.
	
The disease can be removed by first casting <b>break enchantment</b> or <b>remove curse</b> on the subject (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell), after which a <b>remove disease</b>, <b>heal</b>, or similar spell will cure the victim.
	
Focus: A black whip or riding crop, which is cracked in the direction of the intended victims during the casting of the spell.
