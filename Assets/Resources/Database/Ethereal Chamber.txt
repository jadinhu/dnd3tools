<b>You pinch a piece of glass between your fingers and as it crumbles to nothingness, a glassy prison springs into being.</b>
	
You create a translucent prison of pure crystalline force around a target on the Ethereal Plane. You must be able to see or otherwise target the creature you wish to affect.
	
The subject affected by the chamber cannot move on either the Ethereal Plane or its coterminous planes for the duration of the spell but is otherwise unaffected. The subject cannot move onto another plane while inside the chamber, including the Material Plane.
	
The subject within the crystalline prison cannot make physical attacks or be attacked and is unaffected by most spells and supernatural abilities. Gaze attacks and sonic spells function through the walls of the crystalline prison, but a creature within the chamber gains a +2 bonus on saving throws.
	
The target of <b>ethereal chamber</b> can break the crystalline prison by making a Strength check (DC 10 + caster level). A <b>disintegrate</b> spell destroys an <b>ethereal chamber</b>.
	
<b>Material Component:</b> A piece of translucent glass.
