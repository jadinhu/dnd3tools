Dark flames appear in your hand.
You can hurl them or use them to touch enemies.
The flames appear in your open hand and harm neither you nor your equipment.
They emit no light but produce the same amount of heat as an actual fire.
You can strike opponents with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d4 +1 points per two caster levels (maximum +10).
Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon.
When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack.
No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand.
The darkfire is completely invisible to normal vision but can be seen with darkvision as easily as a normal flame can be seen in darkness (this means that darkfire can be used as a signal or beacon for creatures with darkvision).
The spell does not function underwater.
This spell originally appeared in Magic of FaerÃ»n.
