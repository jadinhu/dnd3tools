When you cast this spell, your skin toughens and shimmers as if covered with scales.
You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus, increasing to +3 at 6th level, +4 at 9th level, and +5 at 12th level or higher.
The enhancement bonus provided by scales of the lizard stacks with your own natural armor bonus (if any), but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor.
A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0.
Focus: A tattoo of a lizard on your skin.
