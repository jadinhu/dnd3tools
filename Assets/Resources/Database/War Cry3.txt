You attack with a war cry that bolsters your own courage as well as intimidating your enemies.
As a result of this spell, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attacks and damage, or a +4 morale bonus on attacks and damage made as part of a charge attack.
Any opponent you attack in melee must make a Will save or become panicked.
Once the target makes a successful saving throw against this effect, it cannot be affected by your war cry for one day.
