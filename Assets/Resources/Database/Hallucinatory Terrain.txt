You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain.
Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain.
A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.
Material Component: A stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant.
