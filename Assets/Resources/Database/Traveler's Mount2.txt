The touched animal or magical beast gets a 20-foot enhancement bonus to its speed, and it can hustle without taking damage or becoming fatigued as long as the spell is in effect. While bearing a rider, the mount no longer attacks in combat. The steed willingly bears its rider into battle; it just can't use its own natural weapons for the duration of the spell.
