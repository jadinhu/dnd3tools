You create a visible orb that can fire various ray effects.
The eye can be moved up to your speed as a move-equivalent action but cannot go beyond the spell's range.
Starting on the round it appears, you can command the eye to fire a ray as a free action once per round.
The ray is a ranged touch attack with a +6 attack bonus and a range of 50 feet.
If struck, the target suffers the effect of one of the beams of a prismatic spray spell (roll randomly, rerolling 8s).
Once a particular color ray has been used, it is no longer available to the eye.
Once all seven rays are used, the eye remains and can be moved by you but has no other abilities.
The eye is AC 18 (+8 size) and has 9 hit points.
It saves as you.
Focus: A polished rainbow-hued abalone shell.
