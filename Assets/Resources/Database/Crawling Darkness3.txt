<b>A shroud of dark, writhing tentacles forms around your body as you speak the spell's final syllables.</b>
	
This spell creates a number of tentacles that surround you but do not interfere with your movement of spellcasting. They provide concealment and completely hide your features. You gain a +4 competence bonus on grapple checks, Climb checks, and Escape Artist checks.
	
When you are attacked, the tentacles stricke back at your attacker. They have an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + your Wis modifier, and a succesful attack deals 1d12 points of damage.
