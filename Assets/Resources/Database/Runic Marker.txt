You create a slender stone pillar 2 feet in diameter and 6 feet tall.
It can be square, cylindrical, hexagonal, natural-looking, or any similar shape.
It must be solid and complete (without hollow spaces or secret compartments).
When you create the runic marker, you can also have a message of up to twenty-five words inscribed upon it.
The runic marker also bears a glyph of warding (blast glyph only).
In addition to the normal trigger conditions available for a glyph of warding, you can set it to activate if the pillar ever takes damage from a magical effect.
When the glyph of warding effect activates, the runic marker is destroyed, leaving nothing behind.
Material Component:One vial of holy water.
