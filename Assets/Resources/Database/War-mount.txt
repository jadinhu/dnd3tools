At your touch, your mount's flanks ripple, and its eyes blaze with newfound energy.
You render the natural attacks of your mount or fiendish companion magical with a touch.
The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with its natural weapons for the duration of the spell.
They are treated as both magic and good-aligned (paladin) or evil-aligned (blackguard) weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
If you cast this spell in conjunction with master cavalier (page 124) and phantom charge (page 125), the three spells have a synergistic effect.
See the master cavalier spell description for details.
