This spell summons a shimmering, blood-red chain of pure force that winds around the target, hampering its movement and attacking it.
The spell is named for the unearthly howl the chain emits while constricting its victim.
The noise is so loud that each creature within 100 feet of the chain takes a -2 penalty on Listen checks.
The chain does not hold its victim fast, nor does it prevent the target from acting, but the target takes a -2 penalty on all attacks, saves, and skill checks and must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast any spell with somatic components.
Each round, the chain attacks its target twice (+13/+8 melee), dealing 3d4 points of bludgeoning damage per hit.
Additionally, if the target of the howling chain's attacks attempts to cast a spell during a round in which both of its attacks hit, the Concentration DC increases by 5.
When the howling chain spell is first cast, the target may make a Reflex save to evade its constricting coils.
A successful save means that the chain manifests somewhere within 5 feet of the target.
(Use the rules for missing with a thrown weapon on page 158 of the Player's Handbook to determine where the chain actually appears).
Assuming that the target does not move away, the chain once again attempts to ensnare its designated target on your next action, requiring another Reflex save.
If the designated target is no longer adjacent to the chain, it moves toward its quarry each round at a speed of 20 feet, attacking as soon as possible.
The howling chain is a Medium object with AC 12 and 33 hit points, and it uses your save bonuses for saving throws.
However, all damage dealt to the chain also applies to the target of the howling chain spell.
The target may make a Fortitude save for half damage.
The spell ends when its duration expires, when the chain is destroyed, or when the target dies.
Focus: A small length of platinum chain worth at least 500 gp.
