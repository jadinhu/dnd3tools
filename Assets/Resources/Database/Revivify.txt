Revivify miraculously restores life to a recently deceased creature.
However, the spell must be cast within 1 round of the victim's death.
Before the soul of the deceased has completely left the body, this spell halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the body.
This spell functions like raise dead, except that the raised creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of spells.
The creature is only restored to -1 hit points (but is stable).
Material Component: Diamonds worth at least 1,000 gp.
