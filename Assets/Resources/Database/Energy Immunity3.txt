<b>A sense of security fills you as you complete the spell. As you touch the intended target of the spell, the feeling lingers for a moment before fading.</b>
	
This abjuration grants a creature and its equipment complete immunity to damage from one of the five energy types ï¿½ ;acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. <b>Energy immunity</b> absorbs only hit point damage, so the recipient could still suffer side effects such as drowning in acid, being deafened by a sonic attack, or becoming immobilized in ice (and thus helpless).
	
Energy immunity overlaps <b>protection from energy</b> and <b>resist energy</b>. As long as <b>energy immunity</b> is in effect, the other spells absorb no damage.
