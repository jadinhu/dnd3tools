Your body twists and reshapes itself, allowing you brief freedom from the confines of a wholly humanoid shape.
Upon casting this spell, you briefly acquire a new movement mode and speed, as given on the table below.
Unlike most deity-variable spells, footsteps of the divine does not limit you to the option offered by your own deity; you are free to choose any option presented on the table.
If you choose an option offered by a deity other than your own, however, the spell duration is halved.
You can choose only one option per casting.
Your assumption of a new movement mode, if any, imposes certain physical changes on you.
For instance, if footsteps of the divine grants you flight, you grow wings; if it grants you a burrow speed, you grow heavy digging claws; and so forth.
A &quot; ï¿½ ;&quot; entry indicates that you gain no new movement type, but your base speed increases by the amount indicated.
At any point before the duration expires, you can choose to employ a burst of truly inhuman speed.
Doing so adds an additional +10 feet to your speed per round remaining in the spell's duration.
However, this effect lasts for only a single round, after which the spell ends.
