A warm, comforting glow surrounds your holy symbol, renewing your faith and causing the wicked monsters before you to recoil in fear.
This spell grants you a sacred (if you are good or neutral) or profane (if you are evil) bonus equal to one-half your divine caster level (maximum +5) on your next turning check.
