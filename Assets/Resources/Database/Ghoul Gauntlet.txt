Your touch gradually transforms a living victim into a ravening, flesh-eating ghoul.
The transformation process begins at the limb or extremity (usually the hand or arm) touched.
The victim takes 3d6 points of damage per round while the body slowly dies as it is transformed into a ghoul's cold, undying flesh.
When the victim reaches 0 hit points, she becomes a ghoul, body and mind.
If the victim fails her initial saving throw, cure disease, dispel magic, heal, limited wish, miracle,Mordenkainen's disjunction,
remove curse, wish, or greater restoration negates the gradual change.
Healing spells may temporarily prolong the process by increasing the victim's hit points, but the transformation continues unabated.
The ghoul that you create remains under your control indefinitely.
No matter howmany ghouls you generate with this spell, however, you can control only 2 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level (this includes undead from all sources under your control).
If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (you choose which creatures are released).
If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
