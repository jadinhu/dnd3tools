<b>You complete the casting, and deep within your mind, you feel one of your prepared spells subdividing into three parts, each as powerful as its original.</b>
	
You alter one of your prepared spells so that you can cast it three times before it is expended. The prepared spell must be of 3rd level or lower, and once the triadspell is cast, you can cast the altered spell two additional times (a total of three times) before it is expended. The altered spell functions normally and requires components or XP for each use as if you were casting three separate spells. If you later choose to prepare a different spell in that spell slot, any extra castings provided by the triadspell are lost. You cannot cast triadspell more than once upon a single prepared spell.
