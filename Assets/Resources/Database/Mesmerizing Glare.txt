Directing your gaze toward the target creatures, you cause them to stop and stare blankly at you, mesmerized.
Creatures that fail their saving throws gaze at your eyes, heedless of all else.
Affected creatures are dazed.
Any potential threat (such as an armed opponent moving behind the mesmerized creature) allows the creature a new saving throw.
Any obvious threat, such as casting a spell, drawing a sword, or aiming an arrow, automatically breaks the effect, as does shaking or slapping the creature.
A mesmerized creature's ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action.
