As camouflage, except the effect is mobile with the group.
The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 60 feet from the nearest member of the group.
(If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its camouflage.
If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 60 feet).
