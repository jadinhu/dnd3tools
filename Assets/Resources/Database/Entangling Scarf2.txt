This spell is similar to iron scarf, but you use the scarf to entangle a foe instead of dealing damage.
As with iron scarf, you seize a silk scarf and lash it toward one creature within range, and the scarf magically extends to reach the target and wrap around it.
You must have a line of sight to the target.
You make a ranged attack roll on the target.
If you hit, the target must make a successful saving throw or become entangled.
An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity.
The entangled creature cannot move.
A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell.
An entangled creature can slip free with an Escape Artist check (DC 20), or the scarf can be burst with a Strength check (DC 26).
Focus: A silk scarf.
