Originally developed by medusas, this spell lengthens your tentacles, increasing the reach of your tentacle attacks by 5 feet.
The tentacles attack as normal.
This spell can also increase the length of a medusa's snakes so they may make normal attacks with a 10-foot reach, or they may start a grapple after a successful attack as if you had the improved grab ability.
If the snakes get a successful hold, they can constrict on any following round for 1d3 points of damage plus your Strength modifier with a successful grapple check.
