With a flash of red light and a sound like the screams of a thousand suffering souls, you invest the target with infernal energy, drawing power from an amnizu to power the spell.
You infuse a target with the intellect-sapping power and slippery mind of an amnizu.
While under the effect of this spell, the target can, each round as a standard action, make a single melee touch attack.
A touched creature takes 1d4 points of Intelligence damage.
The subject of this spell can use this touch attack once per two caster levels.
The subject of this spell also becomes immune to any effect that would damage, drain, or otherwise reduce its own Intelligence score.
In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the amnizu).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.
Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.
