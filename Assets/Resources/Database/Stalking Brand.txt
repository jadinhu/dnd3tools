Your touch marks your target with a tiny symbol visible only to you and to detect magic.
The brand appears as you envision it, approximately an inch in diameter.
You can still see the brand, even if the subject uses magical means to change or hide her appearance.
Even spells such as change self, polymorph self, and invisibility do not hide the brand.
To your eyes, the mark glows a light green.
