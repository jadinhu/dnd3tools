The vermin you select pause for a moment as their exoskeletons take on a metallic sheen.
You cause the exoskeletons of up to three vermin to harden to the strength of steel.
The spell increases the vermin's natural armor bonus by 2.
This bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 7th, to a maximum of +6 at caster level 19th.
The enhancement bonus provided by armored vermin stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor.
A vermin with no natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.
