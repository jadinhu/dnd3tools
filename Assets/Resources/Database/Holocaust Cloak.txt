<b>Fire trails from your blade as you spin it about, cloaking you in flames that leap out to burn those who attack you.</b>
	
The flame from your weapon hangs in midair, providing you with a fiery defense against your attackers. An adjacent opponent that hits you with a melee attack while you are in this stance takes 5 points of fire damage. Your holocaust cloak does not harm a creature using a reach weapon to attack you.
This stance is a supernatural ability.
