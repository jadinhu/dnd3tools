The caster causes some bone within a touched creature to break or crack.
The caster cannot specify which bone.
Because the damage is general rather than specific, the target takes 1d3 points of Constitution damage.
A Fortitude save reduces the Constitution damage by half,
or negates it if the full damage would have been 1 point of Constitution damage.
Material Component: The bone of a small child that still lives.
