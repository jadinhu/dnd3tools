You conjure a quasi-real, staglike creature that you can direct to either attack a target or simply carry you on its back.
When you cast the spell, you decide whether you want the stag to appear next to you or form underneath you so that you may ride it immediately.
The stag has a speed of 60 feet and can act as soon as it
appears, moving as you direct.
Controlling the stag is a free action.
It can move through the air as if it were on firm land, as a phantom steed spell (caster level 12th).
It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds of additional weight per caster level.
The stag is a Large creature with an Armor Class of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, + 5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level.
If it loses all its hit points, the spectral stag disappears.
If directed to attack a creature, the stag charges its target and initiates a bull rush.
It has an effective Strength of 18 for this purpose.
The stag cannot be attacked or damaged, but if you are riding it when it attempts a bull rush, the defender may use her attack of opportunity against you instead of the stag.
If the bull rush fails, the stag (and you, if you are riding it) moves 5 feet straight back to where it was before it moved into the target's space.
If the bull rush succeeds, the stag moves the defender the maximum distance possible.
The defender must also make a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.
When the spell ends, the stag vanishes.
If you were riding it at the time, you land safely on the ground.
