You make an area safe from attacks.
This spell functions much like the sanctuary spell.
Anyone attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack anyone within the safe clearing, or anyone attempting to enter the area, must make a Will save.
Success means the creature may act normally and is not affected by this casting of the spell.
Failure means it can't attack anyone in the area or even enter the area for the duration of the spell.
Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected.
This spell does not prevent creatures in the warded area from being attacked or affected by area effect spells.
Those in the safe clearing (even those unaffected by the spell) cannot attack without breaking the spell, but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.
Once the spell is cast, the area protected by safe clearing is immobile.
