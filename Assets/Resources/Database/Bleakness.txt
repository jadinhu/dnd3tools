A pulsing darkness bleeds from your body.
You conjure up a cloud of inky darkness laced with life-sucking energy from the Negative Energy Plane.
Living creatures in the area take 1d6 points of damage each round, starting in the round when they enter the area and at the beginning of their turns each round they remain in the area.
The damage can be prevented by any effect that protects against negative energy, such as death ward.
In addition, undead gain turn resistance +4 and fast healing 3 for as long as they remain in the area of the spell.
Bleakness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
