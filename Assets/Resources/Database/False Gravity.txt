The subject of this spell can travel on any solid surface as though that surface possessed its own gravity.
For example, the subject could walk or even run up a wall as though the wall were a perfectly level floor.
The subject can switch &quot;down&quot; as often as he likes during the spell's duration, though only once per round, as a free action.
Unattended objects fall, as normal.
The subject of false gravity can fly by choosing a solid surface and letting himself fall through the air toward it.
A character &quot;flying&quot; in this fashion moves at 30 feet per round and can make one turn, in any direction, once per round, by redefining his personal gravity.
A character falling in this fashion loses all &quot;downward&quot;
momentum when he changes his gravity.
Material Component: A pair of magnets.
