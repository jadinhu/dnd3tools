For an instant, a translucent sheen that only you can see falls across the area you designate.
Creatures that are within or that enter the area of a sticky floor spell are immediately stuck in place and entangled.
A successful Reflex save means the creature can move from its space but is still considered entangled as long as it remains in the area.
A creature stuck in place can break loose by using a standard action to make a DC 15 Strength check or Escape Artist check.
Each round at the beginning of your turn, any creature within the area must succeed on another Reflex save to avoid becoming stuck in place again.
The effect of this spell even extends through footwear, so merely removing your boots doesn't free you from the effect.
Creatures not in contact with the surface of the ground (such as flying, burrowing or incorporeal creatures) are unaffected by sticky floor.
Kobold sorcerers often use this spell to protect their lairs, and some theorize that they learned it from dragons.
Material Component: A drop of hardened tree sap, which must be eaten by the caster.
