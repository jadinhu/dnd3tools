This spell stops a lycanthrope from changing form, preventing both voluntary shapechanging via the alternate form ability and involuntary shapechanging because of lycanthropy.
The subject retains whatever form he or she had when the spell was cast for the duration; even death does not cause reversion to normal form until the spell ends.
Natural lycanthropes gain a +4 bonus on the saving throw against this spell.
Material Component: A hair, scale, or other cast-off item from the creature to be affected.
