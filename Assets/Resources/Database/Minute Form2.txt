When you cast this spell, your body becomes very small.
The spell causes you to shrink to Tiny or smaller size, depending on your caster level.
Your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and size modifier to AC and attacks all change based on your new size, as shown on the table below.
None of your ability scores can be reduced below 1 by this spell.
The only equipment that changes size with you is ordinary, mundane clothing, so you may not be able to use weapons or magic items effectively in your minute form.
Material Component: A flea.
