The caster creates an area of darkness.
Normal light sources cannot illuminate the area, but darkvision allows a creature to see within the area.
Light counters no light (and vice versa), leaving whatever light conditions normally prevail in the overlapping areas of the spells.
Higher-level light spells counter and dispel no light.
