<b>You cast the spell and sprinkle silver dust around you. Where it lands the dust sparkles and evaporates, and the elemental region around you calms and becomes more hospitable.</b>
	
This spell creates an area around the subject creature that emulates its native planar environment. Thus, a character hailing from the Material Plane would have normal gravity, temperature, magic, and so on. This spell cast on a native of the Plane of Shadow (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 152) would make the area around the creature mimic its home plane's normal gravity, a mild neutral alignment, enhanced shadow spells, and impeded light or fire spells.
	
Arcane Material Component: A sprinkling of silver dust.
