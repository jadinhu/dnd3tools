As teleport, save that you draw upon the power of a storm to teleport yourself and a number of others from one place to another.
Upon casting the spell, the storm suddenly intensifies in the area where the spell was cast, obscuring sight of those affected � ;whether because of a thickening of fog, a sudden increase in the downfall of hail and sleet, or a strike of lightning.
On the next round, the disturbance disappears and the characters affected by the spell are gone.
Though the targets of the spell disappear instantaneously once the spell is cast, they do not immediately reappear at the spell's destination.
Instead, 10 minutes elapse during which a storm quickly develops in the target location.
This is plainly not a natural occurrence to anyone who witnesses it, unless there is already a storm in progress.
Then an intensification of this storm obscures sight at the target location, and the targets of the spell reappear.
The targets always appear in some place that is open to the storm � ;thus, they can appear on the upper parapets of a castle, but not inside the castle.
Though 10 minutes have passed since they disappeared, it appears to the travelers as though the transport were instantaneous.
Additionally, for the 10 minutes while the targets are gone, they are treated as though they were in another plane.
