With a cruel utterance and a complex set of hand signs, you cause great evil to swell within the targeted creature, overwhelming and confusing its sense of morality like a magnet touching a compass.
You temporarily turn one creature evil.
The chaotic/neutral/lawful component of the subject's alignment remains unchanged.
The subject retains whatever outlook, allegiances, and relationships it had before, as long as they do not conflict with its new alignment.
Otherwise, it acts with its new selfish, bloodthirsty, and cruel outlook in all matters.
For example, a wizard affected by this spell might not immediately turn on her fighter companion, particularly in the middle of a combat when they're fighting on the same side.
But she might allow her friend to be hurt or killed if he is carrying a valuable item that she could recover later, or she might use spells to control or deceive him in order to get what she wants.
She might even decide to betray or attack her friend at a later time if significant potential gain is involved.
An atonement spell restores the subject's original alignment, but a remove curse spell has no effect.
Arcane Material Component: A powdered or splintered holy symbol.
