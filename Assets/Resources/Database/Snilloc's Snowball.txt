An icy sphere of bitter cold appears in your hand, harming neither you nor your equipment.
You can use the Snilloc's snowball to strike opponents with a melee touch attack, or you can throw the orb as a ranged touch attack (maximum range 120 feet, no range penalty).
Either use deals 1d6 points of cold damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum 1d6+5).
Right after you hurl the icy sphere, another appears in your hand.
You may throw up to one Snilloc's snowball per caster level (maximum five orbs) before exhausting the spell.
Material Component: A small bit of ivory.
