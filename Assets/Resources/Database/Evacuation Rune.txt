As you finish scribing this bloody rune, the mark flares for an instant and then vanishes.
Even though the rune has disappeared, you feel as though you can step back to it simply by willing it.
You create a magical mark that you can teleport to at a moment's notice.
Upon casting this spell and touching a surface or inanimate object, you create an invisible rune like that created by the spell arcane mark (PH 201).
At any point during the spell's duration you can teleport (as the greater teleport spell) back to the mark as a swift action.
This ends the spell's duration.
After teleporting in this way, you can't take any other actions until your next turn.
The mark created by this spell can be detected in the same ways that an invisible arcane mark can be.
You are not alerted if the mark is dispelled or the object upon which it is inscribed is destroyed.
Any attempt to teleport back to a dispelled or destroyed mark still requires a swift action but fails.
If you created the evacuation rune upon a portable object, that object can be moved by another creature.
You have no knowledge of whether your mark has been moved or where, and upon teleporting to its location, you are subject to any adverse conditions.
If the mark has been moved to another plane, any attempt to teleport to it fails.
If the object inscribed with the evacuation rune is moved somewhere too small for you to appear or is otherwise covered by a solid body, you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location.
If there is no free space within 100 feet, you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet.
If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you take an additional 4d6 points of damage, and the teleport attempt simply fails.
Material Component: The blood of an owl, hawk, or eagle.
