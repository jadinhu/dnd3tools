You conjure a smoky cloud that fills the area with small electrical discharges.
The smoke obscures all sight as a fog cloud does.
In addition, the discharges deal 1d4 points of electricity damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) to everything within the cloud on your turn each round.
As with a fog cloud spell, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can't be cast underwater.
