This spell causes creatures it hits to become weak and slow.
A subject who fails a Will save is slowed as the spell and suffers a cumulative enhancement penalty to Strength equal to 1d6-1 per two caster levels (minimum additional penalty of 0, maximum of -10) each round.
If the subject's Strength drops below 1, it is helpless.
The spell's slow effect counters and is countered by haste.
However, the Strength penalty is not countered by haste.
