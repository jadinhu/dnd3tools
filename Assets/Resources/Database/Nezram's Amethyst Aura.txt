You surround the subject with a brilliant violet glow that grants temporary immunity to poisons and diseases.
Nezram's amethyst aura absorbs all poisons and diseases that target the subject for the duration of the spell, regardless of how they are delivered.
Any weapon or natural attack normally used to deliver a poison or disease (such as a mummy's touch or a snake's bite) still deals the normal amount of hit point damage, but the poison or disease is blocked.
This spell does not reverse or prevent the effects of poison and disease in a subject already affected by one or both at the time of casting.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of amethyst dust.
