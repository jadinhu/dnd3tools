You evoke from the earth an upwelling of virulent green energy, burning any creature in the spell's area for 2d6 points of acid damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum 2d6 +10).
Any creature in the affected area when the spell is cast is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage; any creature that enters the area of the spell while the greenfire is still present gets no saving throw.
The greenfire does not harm natural vegetation, ground cover, or plant creatures, if you so desire.
