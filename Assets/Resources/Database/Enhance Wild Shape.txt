<b>You call upon the primordial energies of nature to fill you with the raw power of nature. A feral feeling grows within you, seeking release.</b>
	
This spell infuses your wild shape ability with magical energy, magnifying and enhancing its power. The type of enhancement must be chosen at the time the spell is cast and cannot be changed once the spell is in effect. The next time you activate your wild shape ability (during the duration of <b>enhance wild shape</b>), this spell enhances your new form in the way you selected. The enhancement to your wild shape remains as long as you stay in that form (or until the spell's duration expires) but does not apply to your next wild shape form. If you do not activate your wild shape ability during the duration of <b>enhance wild shape</b>, the spell has no effect.
	
You select one of the following enhancements when you cast this spell.			Assume the form of a plant with your next wild shape.		Gain the extraordinary abilities of the new form.		The new form assumed is stronger than normal and gains a +2 bonus to Strength.		The new form assumed is more agile than normal and gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity.		The new form assumed is healthier than normal and gains a +2 bonus to Constitution.	
	
A druid can be affected by more than one <b>enhance wild shape</b> spell at a time, but a different wild shape enhancement must be chosen each time.
