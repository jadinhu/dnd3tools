From your fingertips springs a thin line of bright red light that can negate any of several magical or mundane hazards.
Each version of this spell can target one of the hazards described below and &quot;correct&quot; it in the manner described.
Unless specifically stated otherwise, this spell affects
magical and mundane hazards of the indicated type equally.
For example, a ruby ray of reversal can eliminate the webs of a monstrous spider or the effect of a web spell.			Any trap targeted by the ray is sprung.	
This version of the spell may have adverse effects on creatures standing within a trap's area.
You must be aware of a trap to cast ruby ray of reversal on it.			The spell unties knots and causes chains, manacles, and similar restraining devices to fall away.	
Entangle and similar magical effects are dispelled.
Doors (or chests, drawers, cabinets, and so on) that are locked, barred, or under the effect of an arcane lock spell are opened.			A hole with a radius of up to 1 foot is created in a wall of force, forcecage, or similar spell or effect.	
This function of the spell does not destroy the targeted effect, but creatures trapped by it may be able to wriggle free.			A creature that has been polymorphed, turned to stone, or otherwise transformed from its natural state is returned to its natural form.		A magic jar spell is dispelled if a ruby ray of reversal targets the crystal holding the caster's soul.		Webs, slime, grease, and other substances that would hamper movement are destroyed in an area with a radius of up to 20 feet.	
(Treat this effect as a spread, as described on page 175 of the Player's Handbook).
Material Component: A ruby worth at least 1,000 gp.
