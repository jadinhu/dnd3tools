You create a shimmering, mirrorlike area in the air before the recipient's eyes.
The area moves with the recipient and does not affect its vision.
While the spell lasts, there exists a 50% chance that a recipient subjected to a gaze attack need not make a saving throw against the attack, as if averting its eyes, but the foe with the gaze attack is not concealed from the recipient (see Gaze Attacks on page 77 of <span class="caps">DUNGEON</span> MASTER'S Guide).
The recipient gets no additional protection from averting its eyes while the spell lasts, but it can shut its eyes to avoid the gaze.
