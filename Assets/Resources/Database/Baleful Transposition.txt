Two target creatures, of which you may be one, instantly swap positions.
The creatures must be connected by a solid object, such as the ground, a bridge, or a rope.
Both targets must be within range.
Objects carried by the subject creatures (up to the creatures'
maximum loads) go with them, but other creatures do not, even if they are carried.
The movement is instantaneous and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
If either creature succeeds on its Will save, the spell is negated.
