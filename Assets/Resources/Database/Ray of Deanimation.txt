<b>A copper-red ray bursts from your outstretched hand. The sound of grinding gears and breaking metal accompanies the ray's flight.</b>
	
This ray interferes with magical animation, degenerating the magic bound within constructs and effectively causing damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the subject (maximum 15d6).
