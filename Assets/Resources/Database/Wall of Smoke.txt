<b>You wave your hand in a circular motion, and black smoke swirls into existence as a dark wall.</b>
	
This spell creates a thin wall of black smoke. The wall is stationary once created. The wall blocks sight to a limited degree. Creatures on opposite sides of the wall that cannot see over it gain concealment from each other. A creature can pass through a wall of smoke, but it must make a Fortitude save to avoid being nauseated for 1 round.
	
A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, destroys the wall in 1 round.
	
This spell does not function underwater.
