<b>Bombardment</b>(Player's Guide to FaerÃ»n)

Conjuration (Creation)
 <b>Level:</b>  Druid 8,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, AF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
 <b>Area:</b> 15-ft.-radius burst
 <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half; see text
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes

 	
You cause a rain of rocks to fall from the sky, burying your opponents.
You designate the spot on which the burst is centered.
Each creature in the area that fails a Reflex saving throw takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8) and is buried under rubble (see Avalanches, page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
A successful save halves the damage and avoids burial.
Buried subjects are subject to suffocation (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) until they climb out from under the rocks (a full-round action).
Focus: A quartz crystal embedded in rock.
