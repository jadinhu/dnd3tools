Summoning the power of your deity, you charge yourself with positive energy.
This gives you 1d4 temporary hit points per caster level (maximum 10d4), a +2 natural armor bonus, a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, and a +2 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves.
Any undead creature striking you with its body deals you normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1 point of damage from the positive energy, as if from a cure minor wounds spell.
