A needle flicked from your fingers magically penetrates a spirit creature's aura.
If you hit with a normal ranged attack, the spirit loses the protective benefits of being incorporeal and is held in place (losing any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and giving attackers a +4 bonus on attack rolls against it).
Though the spirit cannot move for the duration of the spell, it can still take standard and full-round actions (including attacks).
A pinned spirit is unable to use any supernatural or spell-like ability that would transport it from its current location (such as dimension door or teleport) or alter its substance or state (such as gaseous form or ethereal jaunt).
The spirit cannot remove the needle that pins it in place, but another creature can do so as a standard action.
Focus: A long metal needle.
