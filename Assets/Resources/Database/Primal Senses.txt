Translucent, catlike eyes appear over your own, flaring brightly for a moment before fading to invisibility.
This spell calls upon the primal forces of creation to grant you the senses of your primitive ancestors.
You gain low-light vision and a +5 competence bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
If primal senses is active on you at the same time as primal hunter, primal instinct, or primal speed, you gain uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature).
If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you gain improved uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature; your barbarian level for the purpose of being flanked equals your caster level).
Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), you also gain blindsense out to 10 feet.
