The subject suddenly feels as if the walls of the city are closing in around him.
If the subject fails a Will save, he believes he is trapped in a maze of narrow city alleys that twist and turn in circles.
The subject remains in his current location, but is effectively stunned as long as the spell lasts.
Each round at the end of his turn, the subject may attempt a DC 15 Intelligence check to escape the maze and end the effect.
If the subject takes any damage, the spell immediately ends.
The spell must be cast in a community no smaller than a small town, otherwise it has no effect.
