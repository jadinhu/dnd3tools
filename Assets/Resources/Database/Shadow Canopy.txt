You create a dome of shadow.
The outer surface of the dome is impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, granting 100% concealment to creatures and objects within the spell's area.
A creature under the effect of blacklight cannot see through the dome.
The interior of the dome casts a deep shadow on everything within, reducing the range of normal vision to 5 feet; creatures with darkvision can see normally within the dome.
Light, including sunlight, cannot penetrate the dome.
Creatures that would normally be adversely affected by sunlight, such as shades and vampires, are able to function normally within the dome.
You cannot cast the spell on a point in space or on a mobile object.
All Shadovar expeditions assigned to recover items from old Netherese locations include at least one arcanist able to cast this protective spell.
Shadow canopy counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
Light spells of equal level have no effect on shadow canopy,
but light spells of higher level counter or dispel shadow canopy.
Material Component: A handful of coal dust and the dried eyeball of any diurnal creature.
