<b>You crush your opponent beneath you, squeezing the life out of him as you pin him to the ground.</b>
	
Engaging in close combat against you is, at best, a foolish prospect. Drawing on your understanding of the Stone Dragon discipline, you squeeze a foe within your grasp and force the life from him.
	
While you are in this stance, you gain the ability to constrict for 2d6 points of damage + 1-1/2 times your Str bonus (if any). You can constrict an opponent that you grapple by making a successful grapple check.
