A bright, scintillating light shines from your body.
For the duration of this spell, you emanate a bright light that undead find uncomfortable.
The illumination within the area is bright, the equivalent of a daylight spell.
Undead in the area are dazzled for as long as they remain in the radius and for 1d6 rounds thereafter.
Radiance counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level.
