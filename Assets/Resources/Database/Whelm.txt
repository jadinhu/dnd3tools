You thrust one arm forward toward your foe, palm open and fingers splayed.
The creature reels as an invisible surge of power invades its mind.
You launch a magical assault that wears at the target's mind, dealing 1d6 points of nonlethal damage if it fails its saving throw.
For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you deal an extra 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to the subject, to a maximum of 5d6 at 9th level.
