You create a ramlike force that can strike with considerable power.
Similar to a ring of the ram, the force can target a creature or an object.
The force deals 1d6 hit points of damage to the target.
If the target is a creature, this attack initiates a bull rush.
(The force is considered a Large creature with Strength 25 for this purpose).
If the target is a movable object such as a door, the caster can make a Strength check (using the Strength of the battering ram) to attempt to open the door.
Focus: A piece of carved ram's horn.
