<b>Your foe stops short as a nimbus of glowing light surrounds it. Where it fought you a moment before, it stands transfixed now, caught up in a waking dream.</b>
	
When you cast this spell, you wrap the subject creature in the otherworldly energy of the dreamspace, alterÂ­ing its perceptions and behavior. The creature enters a state of waking dreaming, and is dazed for 1 round. Thereafter, until the spell's duration expires, the target is trapped in a waking dream, unable to differÂ­entiate the random visions of the dream from reality. The creature is treated as shaken, and all its opponents gain concealment.
	
Creatures that do not dream are subject to the effect of this spell unless they are also immune to enchantÂ­ments or mind-affecting spells, powers, and abilities.
	
<b>Special:</b> If you cast this spell while in a dreamtouched state, you can partially direct the random visions that plague the target creature. This allows you to influÂ­ence the actions of the target as if using a <b>suggestion</b> spell. The suggested course of activity continues for the entire duration of the spell.
