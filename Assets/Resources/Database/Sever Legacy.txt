You permanently disrupt the bond between the target creature and its legacy item (or items).
The target is treated as if it had not performed any of the legacy rituals for its item or items.
It loses all of the following feats it has gained for all of its legacy items: Greater Legacy, Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy.
If the target's Hit Dice total exceeds your caster level, the target adds the difference as a bonus on its Will save to negate the effect.
Any creature that successfully saves against this spell cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.
The target does not regain any of the personal costs paid to gain access to legacy abilities.
It can regain access to its item's legacy abilities by performing the requisite rituals again.
In this case, it does not pay again any personal costs that it has already paid.
Other than by again performing the legacy rituals to regain lost feats, the effect of this spell can be negated only by miracle or wish.
