<b>The ground tears at your feet, and you can hear the distant screams of people in pain. An unwholesome red light emanates from the tear and coalesces into the translucent form of a fiend. It sneers at you as the earth closes, then it turns to look at the undead host you chose as the spell's subject. Both the undead and the fiend shudder as they meld together and the red glow dissipates.</b>
	
You summon the spirit of a fiend from the depths of the Nine Hells or the Abyss and bind it into the body of a corporeal undead creature ï¿½ ;either a bodak, devourer, ghast, ghoul, mohrg, mummy, nightshade, skeleton, vampire, vampire spawn, wight, or zombie.
