<b>Components:</b>V, S, M, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes

 <b>Duration:</b> Up to 1 round per level
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (see text)
 <b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes

 	
By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure such as a building, bridge, or dam, you can create a damaging vibration within it.
Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10 points of damage per round to the target structure.
You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round/level, if cast upon a target that is not freestanding, such as a hillside, the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs.
Sympathetic vibration cannot affect living creatures.
A structure gets no saving throw, but a construct gets a Will save to resist the effects.
Material Component: A tuning fork.
