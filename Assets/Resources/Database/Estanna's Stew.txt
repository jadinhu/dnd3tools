This spell calls upon Estanna, goddess of hearth and home (described in Chapter 2: Variant Rules), to fill a specially crafted stewpot with a potent healing stew.
The caster must be hold the pot in hand when Estanna's stew is cast; otherwise, the spell fails and is wasted.
The spell creates one serving per two caster levels (maximum 5).
A single serving heals 1d6+1 points of damage and requires a standard action to consume.
Any portion of the stew that is not consumed disappears after 1 hour.
The stew can be splashed onto a single undead creature within 10 feet.
If a ranged touch attack succeeds, the undead creature takes 1d6+1 points of damage per serving splashed on it.
The undead creature can apply spell resistance and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.
Focus: An engraved stewpot worth at least 50 gp.
