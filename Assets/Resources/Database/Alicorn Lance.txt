You create a horn of force on your forehead, similar in size and shape to a unicorn's horn.
At any time up until the spell expires, you may launch the horn at a single target as a free action.
Striking the target requires a successful touch attack.
If the horn hits, it is destroyed and deals 3d6 points of force damage to the target creature and outlines it in silver-colored faerie fire for the remaining duration of the spell.
If it misses, the spell dissipates.
