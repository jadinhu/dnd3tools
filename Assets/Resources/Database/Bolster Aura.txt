The divine aura that surrounds you begins to swell, sending off waves of faux power into the ether.
By casting bolster aura, you make the aura of the target creature or object stronger, possibly causing other creatures to assume that the target is more powerful than it actually is.
For every two caster levels you possess, the target of a bolster aura spell appears to have 1 Hit Die more than it actually does.
If the target has no aura, then bolster aura has no effect.
