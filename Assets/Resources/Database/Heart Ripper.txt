Heart ripper affects a number of creatures with Hit Dice totaling your caster level, none of which can have more than 4 HD.
Creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first, with creatures of equal Hit Dice affected according to which is closest to the spell's point of origin.
Extra Hit Dice not sufficient to affect remaining creatures are wasted.
Creatures that don't depend on their hearts for survival (such as undead and constructs) and creatures with no anatomy (such as oozes) are unaffected by the spell.
