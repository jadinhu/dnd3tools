The target's eyes widen, and shine briefly with a white light.
The touched creature gains a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks for every three caster levels you have (minimum +1, maximum +6).
In addition, if the target is flanked, its opponents gain no bonus on attack rolls (but still gain any other benefits derived from flanking, such as extra sneak attack damage).
