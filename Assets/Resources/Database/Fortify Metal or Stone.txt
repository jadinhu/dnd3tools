Fortify metal or stone alters the internal structure of stone or metal in order to strengthen it. Any single object of up to 10 feet on a side (weapons, armor, chests, sarcophagi, doors, and so on) has its hardness and hit points doubled, and has its break DC increased by 10.
	
If cast on weapons, fortify metal or stone bestows an enhanceÂ­ment bonus of +1 on damage rolls. Armor or shields affected by this spell grant their wearer damage reduction 1/magic. Suits of armor are considered single objects for the purÂ­pose of being affected by this spell, but armor and shields must be targeted with separate castings.
	
You can use fortify metal or stone on masterwork weapons and armor, but magic items have an effective spell resisÂ­tance of 20 + caster level. Artifacts cannot be affected by this spell.
	
Metal or stone cannot be enhanced more than once by this spell.
