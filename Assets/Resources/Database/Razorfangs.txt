Choose one of your natural weapons that deals slashing or piercing damage (your bite or a single claw).
That natural weapon's threat range doubles (in most cases, becoming 19-20).
This spell does not stack with any other effects that increase a weapon's threat range.
This spell's name derives from a marked preference among dragons for improving their bite attack with this spell, but it works equally well on a claw attack.
