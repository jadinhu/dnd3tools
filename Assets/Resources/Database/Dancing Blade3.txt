With a word and a gesture, the sword in your hand leaps to life with a swooping salute.
This spell animates a melee weapon currently in your possession, causing it to fight your foes as you direct it.
Once each round as a free action, you can direct the blade to attack an adjacent foe (a weapon with reach can attack a foe 10 feet away).
The weapon's bonus on attack rolls is equal to your caster level + your key ability modifier, plus any enhancement bonus the weapon might have.
It deals damage equal to the normal damage of the weapon, plus your key ability modifier and any enhancement bonus or other bonus on damage inherent in the weapon.
The weapon attacks once per round.
Despite the spell's name, it works on any melee weapon (not just blades).
While your weapon is dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and you are not considered armed with the weapon.
It remains in your space and accompanies you everywhere, whether you move by physical or magical means.
The weapon cannot be disarmed.
Focus: The melee weapon that serves as the target of the spell.
