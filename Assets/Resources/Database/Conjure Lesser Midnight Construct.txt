You create a single lesser midnight construct (see page 184).
The creature appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn.
It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability.
As a free action, you can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
The midnight construct acts normally on the last round of the spell's duration and dissipates at the end of its turn.
Midnight constructs are not summoned; they are created on the plane you inhabit, using incarnum you coalesce.
Thus, they are not subject to effects that hedge out or otherwise affect outsiders or summoned creatures.
Essentia: You can invest essentia in a midnight construct when you create it to gain one or more of the following modifications to the construct.
Every point of essentia can be invested in any one modification.			Combat Power: +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls per point of essentia invested.		Damage Reduction: Increase the construct's DR by 2 points per point of essentia invested.		Land Speed Increase: Increase the construct's land speed by 10 feet per point of essentia invested.	
Material Component: A bead of dark glass.
