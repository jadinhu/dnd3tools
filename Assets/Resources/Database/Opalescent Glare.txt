Inspired by the deadly gaze of the noble ghaele eladrin, this spell causes your eyes to glow with a pearly light.
If the target is evil and has 5 or fewer Hit Dice, it dies unless it succeeds on a Will save.
Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a fear spell for 2d10 rounds.
Nonevil creatures and evil creatures with more than 5 Hit Dice are not slain by opalescent glare, and they suffer the fear effect only if they fail the Will save.
