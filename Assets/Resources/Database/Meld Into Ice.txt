Meld into ice enables you to meld your body and possessions
into a single block of ice.
The ice must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions.
When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the ice.
If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
While in the ice, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the ice through which you melded.
You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the ice.
Nothing that goes on outside the ice can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you.
Minor physical damage to the ice does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage.
The ice's complete destruction (by damage or thawing) expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save.
Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the ice through the surface that you entered.
If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.
The following spells harm you if cast upon the ice that you are occupying: Ice to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage.
Ice shape deals you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you.
Thaw expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled.
Finally, pass through ice expels you without damage.
