This barbed-devil-inspired transmutation causes the subject to grow a covering of sharp barbs from its skin, equipment, or clothing, whichever is appropriate when the spell is cast.
Any creature striking the subject with a handheld weapon or a natural weapon takes 1d8 points of slashing and piercing damage from the subject's barbs.
This damage does not apply to attackers using reach weapons, such as longspears.
The subject itself is not harmed by its own barbs.
Material Component: A thorn.
