A glittering corona of sunlight surrounds your body at a few inches distance ï¿½ ;until you release it as a focused blast of divine energy.
The nimbus of light glows like a lantern, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius (and dim light for an additional 30 feet) from you.
As a move action, you can coalesce the energy from the nimbus of light around your outstretched arm, and then as a standard action fling it toward a foe within 30 feet.
As a ranged touch attack, the nimbus of light deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per round that's elapsed since you cast the spell (max of 1d8 + caster level damage).
Attacking with the nimbus of light ends the spell, whether the energy hits its target or not.
