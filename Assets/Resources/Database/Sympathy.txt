The particular kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically � ;for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasus, or vampires.
A creature subtype (such as goblinoid) is not specific enough.
Likewise, the specific alignment must be named � ;for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, or neutral.
Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or to possess the object.
The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering.
If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6x;10 minutes later.
If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.
Sympathy counters and dispels antipathy.
