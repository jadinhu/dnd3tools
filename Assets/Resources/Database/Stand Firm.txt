The stand firm spell was a creation of Thrane divine warriors to be used as a defense against Karrnath?s mighty cavalry. All subjects of the spell gain a +4 morale bonus to Armor Class against charge attacks, and on opposed checks for the purpose of defending against bull rushes, grapples, overrun attacks, and trip attacks.
	
The spell remains in effect on a subject (up to its maximum duration) so long as that subject does not move. If a subject moves, taking even so much as a 5-foot step, it loses the spell?s benefit.</
