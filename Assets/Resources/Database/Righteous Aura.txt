You are bathed in an unearthly glow for the duration of the spell (as if a daylight spell had been cast on you).
You get a +4 sacred bonus to your Charisma score.
If you die, your body is converted into an explosive blast of energy in a 20-footradius burst centered where you fell, dealing 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all nongood creatures in the burst's area.
Good creatures in the area are healed by the same amount, and undead take double this damage.
Spell resistance cannot prevent this damage, but a successful Reflex save reduces it to half.
Your body is disintegrated, so you cannot be raised with a raise dead spell.
Spells that do not require an intact body, such as true resurrection, can be used to bring you back to life as normal.
