This spell makes your eyes glow with white light and allows you to see evil auras within 120 feet of you.
The effect is similar to a detect evil spell, but does not require concentration and discerns aura location and strength more quickly.
You know the location and strength of all evil auras within your sight.
An aura's strength depends on the type and Hit Dice of any evil creature, as noted in the description of the detect evil spell in the Player's Handbook.
