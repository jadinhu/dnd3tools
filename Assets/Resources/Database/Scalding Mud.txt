This spell functions as transmute rock to mud (see page 295 of the Player's Handbook), except that it can be cast on sand, earth, and unworked, nonmagical rock (within the normal restrictions for transmute rock to mud), and the mud created is boiling hot.
Creatures mired in the hot mud take 5d6 points of fire damage per round, while those completely submerged in the sludge take 10d6 points of fire damage per round.
Creatures atop the mud (such as those standing on straw) take 1d6 points of fire damage each round from hot steam.
Damage from boiling mud continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only 1d6 points of fire damage per round.
The transmuted material cools after a period of 1 round per caster level.
The number of dice of damage the mud deals is halved each round after this duration expires.
The transmuted rock remains as mud even after it cools.
It eventually dries into soil, as per transmute rock to mud.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of a mixture of clay, sulfur, and water.
