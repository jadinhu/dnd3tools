This visually impressive spell causes a surging, frothing wave of thick, red seawater that washes over everything in the area.
All creatures in the area of a red tide are immediately knocked prone and must make a Fortitude saving throw.
Flying or swimming creatures in the area aren't knocked prone, but they take a -4 penalty on the Fortitude save.
A living creature who makes its Fortitude save against a red tide is sickened for 1 minute and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for that time.
A creature who fails this saving throw feels the full effect of the red tide.
Such creatures are immediately nauseated for 1 minute (unable to attack, cast spells, or concentrate), and they take 3d6 points of Strength damage.
After 1 minute the nausea ends, but the creature must make a second Fortitude saving throw or take an extra 3d6 points of Strength damage.
Creatures immune to poison are immune to these effects of a red tide.
The tainted water evoked by this spell vanishes after a few seconds of turbulence, and any objects or creatures in the area do not emerge wet.
All open flames in the area are nevertheless extinguished if they fail a Reflex save, and all creatures with the fire subtype take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6; Fort save half).
