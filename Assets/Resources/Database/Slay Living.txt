You can slay any one living creature.
You must succeed on a melee touch attack to touch the subject, and it can avoid death with a successful Fortitude save.
If it succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level.
(Of course, the subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its save).
