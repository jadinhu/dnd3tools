You turn up to five gems into bombs you (and only you) can lob at enemies.
You must hold the gems in your hand when casting the spell.
Together, the bombs are capable of dealing 1d8 points of force damage per two caster levels (maximum of 5d8), divided up among the gems as you wish.
A 10th-level cleric could create one 5d8 bomb, a 3d8 and 2d8 bomb, five 1d8 bombs, or any combination of five dice of damage and up to five gems.
You can toss the bombs up to 100 feet with a range increment of 20 feet.
A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target.
A creature struck can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.
Tossing a gembomb counts as an attack for you, so you usually cannot toss one during the turn that you cast the spell.
You can only toss one bomb at a time, but you can toss more than one each round if you have multiple attacks.
Material Components:Up to five gems worth at least 1 gp each
