You call up raw Tainted power to smite your enemies.
The Taint takes the form of a cold, cloying cloud of greasy darkness.
Nezumi, Shinomen nagas, and creatures with the Shadowlands subtype are not harmed by the spell, and creatures with a Taint score are not fully affected.
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to untainted creatures and sickens them for 1d4 rounds.
A sickened creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks.
A successful Fortitude save reduces damage to half and negates the sickening effect.
Sickened creatures must make an additional successful Fortitude save or gain a Taint score of 1d3.
The spell deals only half damage to creatures with Taint scores, and they are not sickened.
They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Fortitude save.
Such Tainted creatures automatically increase their Taint score by 1, regardless of their saving throw results.
