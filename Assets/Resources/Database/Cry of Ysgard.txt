You call 2d4 bariaur defenders of Ysgard (see Chapter 8: Monsters) from the plains of Ysgard to your location.
They serve you for up to a year, and you may dismiss them at any time.
They are intelligent, so you can assign them different tasks.
They can refuse to complete a quest or otherwise take on complex burdens without your supervision.
No matter how many times you cast this spell, you can control no more than four bariaur rangers; others are released from service and return to Ysgard immediately.
You choose which creatures to release.
Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Strength drain.
