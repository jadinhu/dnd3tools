The caster enchants a creature so that it feels suddenly compelled to give her what it is holding when she casts the spell.
On the creature's next action, it moves as close to the caster as it can get in a single round and offers her the object as a standard action.
This spell allows the caster to act out of turn and accept the &quot;gift&quot; if the creature reaches her to hand the caster the object (assuming she has a free hand and can carry the object).
The subject defends itself normally and acts however it wishes on subsequent rounds, including attempting to get the object back if desired.
If the subject is prevented from doing as the spell compels, the spell is wasted.
For example, if the subject is paralyzed and cannot move or drop the item, nothing happens.
