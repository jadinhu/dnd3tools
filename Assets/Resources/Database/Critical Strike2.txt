As you complete this spell, you sense the blood rushing through your target's veins.
This spell guides your next attack to your foe's vital spots.
Your next single attack roll (if it is made before the end of the next round) ignores any miss chance due to concealment.
(In the case of a foe that has total concealment, you must still attack the correct square).
This even allows you to deliver a sneak attack against a foe that has concealment.
