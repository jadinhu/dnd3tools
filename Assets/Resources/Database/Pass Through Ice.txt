The transmuted creature is able to pass through ice or snow as easily as water, but not through stone or frozen mud.
The creature moves at a speed of 15 feet and can rise or sink into ice at a rate of 5 feet per round.
When a pass through ice spell ends, the affected creature is ejected out to the nearest ice surface.
If someone dispels pass through ice or you dismiss it while a creature is still in the ice, the creatures may be trapped in
the ice unless they can reach the nearest surface within a single round of movement.
Creatures trapped act as if caught in an entomb spell.
