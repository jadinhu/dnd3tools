<b>You speak the words of this spell, and tendrils of purple darkness rise from the ground, surrounding you and concealing you from your foes.</b>
	
Swirling wisps of darkness obscure your form, granting you concealment. The 20% miss chance is in effect even if the attacker has darkvision.
	
This spell effect is dispelled in daylight or in the area of a light spell of 3rd level or higher.
	
<b>See invisibility</b> does not counter a <b>veil of shadow</b>'s concealment effect, but a <b>true seeing</b> spell does.
