The creature you touch undergoes a transformation that allows it to survive in the terrible lightless depths of the oceans.
This creates subtle changes in the spell's target, whose eyes become completely black and whose flesh becomes hard and cold.
The target of this spell gains the ability to breathe water and is rendered immune to damage from both the temperature and the pressure in extreme depths of water.
Additionally, she gains darkvision out to 60 feet.
Material Component: A bit of stone or mud from a deep ocean trench.
