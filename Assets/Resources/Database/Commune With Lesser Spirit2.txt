You contact a local spirit ï¿½ ;any spirit creature with 4 or fewer HD.
You must know the identity of the spirit (which you can learn through the trance spell), and you must be within 10 feet of the spirit's location.
You may ask up to one question per 2 caster levels.
Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires.
The spirit's knowledge is limited to matters within its immediate area, so the spirit of a great tree in the village could not answer questions about events outside the village.
Spirits usually answer questions literally and do not volunteer any information.
If the spirit's alignment is different from yours, the spirit gets a Will save to resist the spell.
If the spirit has been subject to commune with lesser spirit within the past week, the new spell fails.
Good spirits generally try to be helpful in answering questions, while evil spirits always try to distort the information they give (though they generally give literally truthful answers).
Material Component: Incense and a small offering worth 10 gp.
