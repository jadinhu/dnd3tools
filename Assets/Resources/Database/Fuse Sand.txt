This spell causes normal sand to melt slightly and stick, forming a relatively soft and porous building material (see Dungeon Waste Terrains, page 31).
Any creature in the sand is allowed a Reflex save to escape before the area hardens.
Creatures that are unable to escape become trapped and must be broken out.
A creature trapped beneath the surface begins to suffocate (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
The fused sand has hardness 3 and 5 hp per inch of thickness, and a break DC of 22.
Material Component: A glass marble.
