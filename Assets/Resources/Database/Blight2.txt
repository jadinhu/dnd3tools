This spell has two versions.
To cast either version, you must touch a plant and breathe on it.
Blight Area:When you center this spell on a single normal plant, all normal plants within a 100-foot spread (including the one on which the spell was centered) immediately die.
Flowers wilt, leaves fall to the ground, and foliage withers.
This spell has no effect on the soil, so new growth can replace the dead plants.
This effect allows no saving throw.
Blight Plant Creature:When targeted on a single mobile or intelligent plant, such as a shambling mound or a treant, this spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level, to a maximum of 15d6.
The plant receives a Fortitude save for halt damage.
