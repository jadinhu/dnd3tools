You tap the incredible complexity of the draconic Prophecy, granting creatures in the area a burst of insight powerful enough to threaten their sanity. Creatures in the area take a -2d6 penalty to Wisdom and are confused for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the penalty by half and negates the confusion.
