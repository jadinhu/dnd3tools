This spell moves snow and ice.
The area to be affected determines the casting time.
For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes.
The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
This spell does not violently break the surface of snow or ice.
Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved.
Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.
The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures.
Its primary use is for digging or adjusting terrain contours before a battle.
This spell has no effect on ice creatures.
Material Component: A mixture of snow and ice in a small bag, and an iron blade.
