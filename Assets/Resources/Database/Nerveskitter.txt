You cast this spell when you and your party roll for initiative. Unlike other immediate actions, you can cast this spell while flat-footed. You enhance the subject's reactions in combat, granting it a +5 bonus on its initiative check for the current encounter. If the subject does not make an initiative check within 1 round, this spell has no effect.
