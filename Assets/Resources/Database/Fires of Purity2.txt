The creature you touch bursts into magical flames that do not harm the target, but are quite capable of harming anyone else who comes into contact with them.
The target deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with a successful melee attack.
Creatures hitting the target with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take 1d6 points of fire damage, and must succeed at a Reflex save (the same DC as the spell) or catch fire.
The flame burns for 1d4 rounds (see Catching on Fire in Chapter 3 of the <span class="caps">DUNGEON</span> MASTER's Guide).
A burning creature can take a move-equivalent action to put out the flame.
The target gains fire immunity for the duration of the spell, but takes double damage from cold except on a successful save.
