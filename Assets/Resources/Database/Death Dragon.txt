<b>Death Dragon</b>(Draconomicon)

Necromancy [Evil, Fear, Mind-Affecting]
 <b>Level:</b>  Cleric 7,    
<b>Components:</b>V, S, DF, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 round
 <b>Range:</b> Personal
 <b>Effect:</b> Dragon-shaped armor of energy and bones
 <b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)

 	
You summon unholy power to gird yourself in a dragon-shaped cocoon of bones and negative energy.
The cocoon gives you a +4 enhancement bonus to your natural armor and a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class, plus 1 temporary hit point per caster level (maximum 20).
You are treated as armed when you make unarmed attacks, and you deal damage as if your limbs were short swords of an appropriate size.
You can use your off hand to attack, incurring the standard two-weapon fighting penalties (see page 160 of the Player's Handbook).
The death dragon prevents you from casting spells with somatic, material, or focus (but not divine focus) components, but does not otherwise hinder your actions or movement.
As a standard action, you may project a cone of fear or make a melee touch attack to use inflict critical wounds on the creature touched.
These effects are otherwise identical to the spells of the same names.
