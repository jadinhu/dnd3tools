You hamper the subject creature's ability to fly (whether through natural or magical means) for the duration of the spell.
If the target fails its saving throw, its fly speed (if any) becomes 0 feet.
An airborne creature subjected to this spell falls to the ground as if under the effect of a feather fall spell.
Even if a new effect would grant the creature the ability to fly, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the earthbind spell.
If the target makes a successful Fortitude save, its fly speed (including any new effect granted during the spell's duration) is reduced by 10 feet per caster level (maximum reduction 100 feet at 10th level).
This reduction can't bring the creature's fly speed down to less than 10 feet.
Earthbind has no effect on other forms of movement, or even on effects that might grant airborne movement without granting a fly speed (such as jumping or levitate or air walk spells).
