Each round, you concentrate on one subject, who must be within range.
You know if the subject deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying.
The spell does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions.
Each round, you may concentrate on a different subject.
