<b>Static fills the air as you complete the spell. With a gesture you create magical conductivity between two creatures, and a bolt of electricity arcs between them with a shockingly loud crackle.</b>
	
This bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to both creatures and to anything in the line between them.
	
Both creatures must be in range, and you must be able to target them both (as if this spell had them as its targets). Draw the line from any corner in one creature's space to any corner in the other's space. The bolt affects all squares in this line.
	
<b>Arcane Material Component</b>: Two small iron rods.
