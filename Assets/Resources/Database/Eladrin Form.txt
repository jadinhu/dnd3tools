You assume the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch colors, 5 feet in diameter.
In this form, you can fly at a speed of 150 feet with perfect maneuverability and can pass through walls and other solid objects.
You can use any spell-like or psionic abilities you possess, but you cannot cast spells or make physical attacks.
The globe form is incorporeal, and you have no Strength score while in that form.
While incorporeal, you can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, psionics, spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities.
You are immune to all nonmagical attack forms.
Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons).
