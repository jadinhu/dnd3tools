You bestow upon the target an unusual curse: The first spell the target casts that meets the triggering conditions rebounds on the cursed creature exactly as if affected by spell turning.
The backlash is triggered by three situations:			The target casts an attack spell on another creature, which makes its saving throw.		The target casts an attack spell upon a creature that is immune to that spell.		The target casts an attack spell that is interrupted or ruined (including a failed attempt to cast defensively).	
In all three cases, the triggering spell must be a spell that could be affected by spell turning.
If the backlash is triggered, the curse immediately takes its full effect upon the target of the backlash.
The target does not get a saving throw against the spell, nor does spell turning apply, but does get spell resistance.
Once triggered, the backlash spell ends.
A creature can be under the effects of multiple backlash spells at once, but only one can be triggered at a time.
The backlash has no effect on magic items or spell-like or supernatural abilities used by the target.
A backlash can be removed by any spell that negates a bestow curse spell.
For purposes of this spell, an &quot;attack spell&quot; includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe.
(Exactly who is a foe depends on the caster's perceptions).
A spell directed at an unattended object does not constitute an attack spell.
