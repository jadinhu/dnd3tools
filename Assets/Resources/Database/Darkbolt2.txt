You unleash beams of darkness from your open palm.
You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike your target.
You can hurl one darkbolt for every two caster levels you have (maximum seven bolts).
You can hurl all the bolts at once, or you can hurl one bolt per round as a free action, starting on the round when you cast the spell.
You do not have to hurl a bolt every round, but if you don't hurl the bolt you were entitled to that round, it is lost.
If you hurl all the bolts at once, all your targets must be within 60 feet of each other.
A darkbolt deals 2d8 points of damage to a living creature, and the creature is dazed for 1 round unless it makes a Will save (a creature struck by multiple bolts during the same round is dazed for a maximum of 1 round, no matter how many times it fails its save).
Undead take no damage, but are dazed if they fail their saves.
