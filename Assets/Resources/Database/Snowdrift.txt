You can form existing snow into any shape that suits your purpose.
For example, you can make a snowbank for concealment, sculpt a snow statue or idol, open a tunnel in deep snow, or simply cover a set of tracks.
Snowdrift also permits you to raise snowy barriers around a door or house to prevent vision in or out, or to clog a chimney with snow.
Snow cannot be made into weapons with this spell, and snowdrift does not affect solid ice in any form.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch of white flour.
