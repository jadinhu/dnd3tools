You create an aura of blue mist that protects you against fire, absorbing the first 12 points of fire damage as an endure elements spell.
In addition to the endure elements (fire) effect, the spell can be used to snuff out fires.
Any nonmagical flame that the aura contacts is immediately extinguished if the flame's maximum damage is 12 or fewer points per round.
This means that torches, small fires, and hurled alchemist's fire are snuffed out and cause no damage if used against you or if you touch them.
You may use a standard action to touch an existing magical fire (such as a flaming sphere or a wall of fire) and attempt to dispel it as if using a dispel magic spell against it.
If you succeed, the magical fire and the aura both vanish.
If you fail, both remain.
You may use a ready action to use the aura as a dispel magic to counterspell a magical fire attack against you.
If successful, the spell is counterspelled and the aura disappears.
If you fail the dispel check or the attack is not a fire attack, nothing happens and the aura remains.
