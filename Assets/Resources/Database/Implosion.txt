You create a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature's body.
For each round you concentrate, you cause one creature to collapse in on itself, killing it.
(This effect, being instantaneous, cannot be dispelled).
You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell.
Implosion has no effect on creatures in gaseous form or on incorporeal creatures.
