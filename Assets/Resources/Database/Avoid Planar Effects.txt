You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane.
These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself.
Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage on a plane with the fire-dominant trait.
Avoid planar effects lets a character breathe water on a water-dominant plane and be immune to suffocation on an earth-dominant plane.
A character protected by avoid planar effects can't be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character's normal hit point total.
Negative-dominant planes don't deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects.
In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects.
In the D&amp;D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells.
You can add additional protections for a cosmology you create.
If you have an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage suffered by everyone on the plane.
The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait that some planes have (Elysium and Hades in the D&amp;D cosmology).
The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane.
This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, but it won't protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane.
