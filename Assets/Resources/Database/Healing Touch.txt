You transfer some of your life essence to another creature, healing it.
You may heal up to 1d6 hit points per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), and must decide how many dice to roll when you cast the spell.
You take damage equal to the amount the target is healed.
This spell cannot restore more hit points to a target than your current hit points +10, which is enough to kill you.
