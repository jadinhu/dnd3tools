As you speak the arcane words, you feel the laws of reality bending around your companion, undoing his failure.
You grant the subject the chance to reroll a skill check.
You must cast this spell after the skill check has been rolled, but before success or failure has been determined.
The subject makes the new check immediately and must abide by the results of the second roll.
The subject can't take 10 or 20 on this reroll.
