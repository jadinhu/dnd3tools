<b>Upon completing the spell, a discordant cacophony of haunting and alien music rises up in the area you designate. Although the strange music reaches your ears, you feel no effect from it.</b>
	
Creatures that fail their save become affected by the haunting fugue in semirandom ways. On each affected creature's turn (as long as it remains in the affected area), you make a Perform check. The check result determines how the victim's mind and body are affected by the spell. You can select any of the effects for Which your Perform check equals or exceeds the required DC.
