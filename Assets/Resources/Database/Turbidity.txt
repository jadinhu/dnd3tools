You cause the water surrounding you to swirl and fill with suspended sediments, decreasing visibility and making it harder for foes to attack you.
This roiling cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
Creatures within the area up to 5 feet from an attacker have concealment (20% miss chance), while those farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance).
Creatures other than you within this cloud must make a Concentration check to cast a spell (DC 15 + spell level).
Ranged attacks that pass through the turbidity automatically fail.
A vigorous current (1-3 knots) disperses the clouded water in 4 rounds; a dangerous or stronger current (4 or more knots) disperses it within 1 round.
This spell only functions under water.
Material Component: A handful of mud.
