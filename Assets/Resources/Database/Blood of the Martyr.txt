You may transfer your own hit points directly to a target creature within range.
You must transfer at least 20 points.
Transferred hit points are damage to you.
The creature takes your transferred hit points as if receiving a cure wounds spell and cannot gain more hit points than its maximum allows; any excess points are lost.
This spell transfers only actual hit points, not temporary hit points.
An unconscious target is considered a &quot;willing creature&quot; for purposes of this spell.
