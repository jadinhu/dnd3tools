Your touch causes one spell to rip free of its source and dissipate into nothingness.
You can use dispelling touch to end an ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, or a spell that has a noticeable ongoing effect.
You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell effect with the highest caster level.
If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell or until you fail all your checks.
Magic items carried by a creature are not affected.
