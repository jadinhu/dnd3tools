You emit a thunderous, devastating yell.
The primary effect is a line of intense sonic energy 5 feet high and 5 feet wide and as long as the spell's range.
Stone, crystal, and metal objects in the area take 20d6 points of damage.
Creatures holding vulnerable objects can attempt Reflex saves to negate the damage.
Objects that survive the spell's primary effect are not subject to the secondary effect.
The spell's secondary effect is a cone of sound centered on the line.
Creatures within the cone take 10d6 points of damage, and are stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds.
A successful Fortitude save negates the stunning and halves both the damage and the duration of the deafness.
Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
Creatures holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with successful Reflex saves.
A deafened character, in addition to the obvious effects, suffers a -4 penalty on initiative and a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal (V) component that he tries to cast.
The great shout spell cannot penetrate the spell silence.
Arcane Focus: A small metal or ivory horn.
