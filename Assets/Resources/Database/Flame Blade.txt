A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand.
You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a scimitar.
Attacks with the flame blade are melee touch attacks.
The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10).
Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage.
A flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.
The spell does not function underwater.
