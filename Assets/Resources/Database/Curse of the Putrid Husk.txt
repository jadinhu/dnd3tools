This illusion forces the subject to believe his flesh is rotting and falling off his body, and that his internal organs are spilling out.
If the target fails his saving throw, he is dazed (and horrified) for 1 round.
On the following round, he falls unconscious for 1d10 minutes, during which time he cannot be roused normally.
