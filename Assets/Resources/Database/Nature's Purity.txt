A shimmering green beam of light springs forth from your outstretched hand.
You can direct this ray at any target in range.
If you hit the target, the ray deals 1d6 points of force damage.
Against undead and constructs, the ray deals 2d8 points of force damage.
Against aberrations, the ray deals 5d6 points of force damage and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
An aberration slain by this damage is immediately transformed into pungent-smelling inert plant matter.
You can generate one additional ray for every four levels above 5th (to a maximum of four rays at 17th level).
The rays can be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.
