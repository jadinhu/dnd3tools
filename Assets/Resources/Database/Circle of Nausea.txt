Evil energy bursts in all directions from the spell's origin, filling the area with pain.
Everyone in the spell's area must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.
Those who succeed at the saving throw must make a new saving throw each round if they remain in the area.
The pain lasts as long as the spell does.
The caster stands in the circle, which must be prepared ahead of time by inscribing a circle on the ground and putting a stone on the circle at each of the four cardinal directions.
Creating this circle takes 1 hour, but once created it may be reused any number of times.
If anyone attempts to cross the circle during the spell's duration, she must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated until the spell ends, unable to take actions other than a single move or move-equivalent action.
Nauseated characters cannot cross the circle.
If someone breaches the circle without becoming nauseated, the spell ends.
