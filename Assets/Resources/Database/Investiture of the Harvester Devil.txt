A deep chuckle sounds as you complete the incantation, and motes of violet light surround the target, imbuing it with infernal energy drawn from a harvester devil.
The target of this spell deals horrific, lingering wounds with its melee attacks.
If it successfully strikes an opponent with a melee attack, it causes an infernal wound that deals an extra 1d6 points of damage each round until the creature dies, or until the struck creature is the recipient of a DC 20 Heal check, a cure spell, or a heal spell.
A creature can be affected by the lingering damage of only one such infernal wound at a time.
In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the harvester devil).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.
Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.
