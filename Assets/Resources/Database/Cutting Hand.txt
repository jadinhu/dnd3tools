You alter the structure of your hand so that it becomes as hard and sharp as a blade. Your hand deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are small, and 1d8 if you are large) and gains a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage. You are considered armed with this hand. Your hand's enhancement bonus does not apply to melee touch attacks.
