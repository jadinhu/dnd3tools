You bring into being a shroud of dark, writhing tentacles around your body.
The tentacles do not interfere with your movement or spellcasting, but they provide you one-half concealment (20% miss chance) and totally hide your features.
You get a +4 competence bonus on grapple checks, Climb checks, and Escape Artist checks.
Crawling darkness automatically protects you with a feather fall effect if you ever fall more than 3 feet and allows you to use water walk at will.
