The infernal wound spell makes a weapon inflict persistent wounds similar to those made by bearded devils and horned devils.
A creature injured by a weapon with infernal wound cast upon it loses 2 additional hit points each round for the remaining duration of the spell.
The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a Heal check (DC 10 + spell level + caster's ability modifier), a cure spell, or a heal spell.
