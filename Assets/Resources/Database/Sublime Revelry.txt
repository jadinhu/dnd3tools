Sublime revelry immediately removes any lingering effects of pain, including penalties imposed by symbol of pain, angry ache, and similar spells.
It does not prevent damage or block other effects not directly related to pain.
The spell also induces a pleasurable fuguelike state that yields the following additional effects:
First, sublime revelry renders its targets immune to mind-affecting spells and effects for the spell's duration, as well as suppresses (but not dispels) ones currently in effect.
Second, targets of the spell take only half damage from all melee and ranged attacks for the duration of the spell.
