<b>After a few mystic words, you touch a piece of rotten meat to the subject and it sinks inside the creature's body.</b>
	
Any creature that bites the spell's subject must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated until the end of its next turn.
	
If a creature of animal Intelligence (2 or lower) fails its saving throw, it will not willingly bite the subject a second time; someone trying to direct the creature to bite the subject again must make a Handle Animal check as if he was trying to &quot;push&quot; the creature. This check must be made every time he tries to make the creature bite.
	
Creatures that are immune to poison or that lack the ability to taste are unaffected by this spell.
	
Material Component: A pinch of rotten meat.
