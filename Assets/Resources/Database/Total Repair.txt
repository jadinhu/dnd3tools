Total repair enables you to transmute the structure of a construct to wipe away damage and affl ictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, feebleminded, and insanity. It also repairs 10 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.
