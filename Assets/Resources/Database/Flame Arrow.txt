You turn ammunition (such as arrows, bolts, shuriken, and stones) into fiery projectiles.
Each piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage to any target it hits.
A flaming projectile can easily ignite a flammable object or structure, but it won't ignite a creature it strikes.
Material Component: A drop of oil and a small piece of flint.
