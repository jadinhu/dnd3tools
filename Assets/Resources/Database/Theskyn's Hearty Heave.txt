Created by a court mage serving the Stag King of Athalantar, this spell provides you with a bit of breathing room when you are threatened by swarming foes.
When you cast the spell, you project a blast of concentric force that pushes away creatures surrounding you.
Each creature is affected as if it had been subjected to a bull rush maneuver by a foe of Large size with a Strength score equal to 20 + your caster level (maximum 25), and the attacker had moved with the target (though you need not move at all).
Movement caused by this spell provokes attacks of opportunity, just as the movement resulting from a normal bull rush would.
Creatures grappling you are not affected by this spell.
