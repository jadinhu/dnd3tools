You temporarily sever one or more chakra binds between the target and his soulmelds and/or magic items.
This affects one chakra bind for every four caster levels, to a maximum of three binds at 12th level.
For the spell's duration, the target creature loses all benefits of the severed chakra binds.
The target also takes 1d6 points of damage per chakra bind severed.
At the time of casting, you can choose particular chakra binds to sever (such as arms or soul).
If you do not choose specific chakra binds, the DM randomly determines which chakra binds are affected.
Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in this spell adds +1d6 to the damage dealt per chakra bind severed.
