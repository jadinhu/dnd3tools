Flecks of rust melt together and lose their ruddy hue.
The metal creaks as it re-forms and straightens itself.
You instantly restore a single metal object that has been damaged or destroyed by rust.
This works even if the object has been reduced to powder, such as by the rusting grasp spell.
Even if the object is partly missing, such as one partially consumed by a rust monster, the spell functions as long as at least 1/4 of the object remains.
This spell does not restore the magical properties of any magic item or construct destroyed by rust.
A slain or destroyed metallic creature such as an iron golem is restored in physical form, but it remains &quot;dead&quot;, having lost all magical qualities.
