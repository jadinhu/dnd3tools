<b>Reaching out with your thoughts, you break through your target's mental defenses and reap answers to your desires.</b>
	
All of the subject's memories and knowledge are accessible to you, ranging from memories deep below the surface to those still easily called to mind. You can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the subject's knowledge. You pose the questions telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the subject do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures might yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to your questions. The subject is not aware that its mind is being probed, unless you wish to make it aware.
	
If the subject moves beyond the range of the spell, the effect ends.
