A node lock spell cast upon a node magically &quot;locks&quot; it against others who might wish to use its power.
You can affect a node whose class is equal to one-half your caster level or less.
For any caster except you, a node lock adds +15 to each Spellcraft DC associated with the use of the node's standard powers.
In addition, the node cannot be detected by a locate node spell.
A successful dispel magic breaks a node lock.
Special: You must have the Node Spellcasting feat to cast this spell.
