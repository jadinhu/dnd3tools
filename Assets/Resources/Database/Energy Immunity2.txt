This abjuration grants a creature complete protection against damage from whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.
Energy immunity absorbs only damage.
The recipient could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning results from a lack of oxygen), being deafened by a sonic attack, or becoming encased in ice.
The effect of this spell does not stack with similar effects, such as resist energy and protection from energy, that protect against the same energy type.
If a character is warded with energy immunity (fire) and is also receiving resistance to fire from one or more of the other spells, the energy immunity makes the other spells irrelevant.
However, it is possible to be simultaneously under the effect of energy immunity (fire) and resist energy (electricity), or any other two such spells that protect against different types of energy.
