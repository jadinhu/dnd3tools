You conjure a number of shining metallic bands out of thin air, encircling a Medium or smaller creature.
The victim must succeed on a Reflex save or be immobilized (helpless).
If the saving throw succeeds, the victim is only partially trapped by the bands (treat as entangled).
A creature immobilized by the bands can attempt escape as a fullround action, either by bursting free (Strength DC 18) or wriggling out (Escape Artist DC 18).
An entangled creature can use a full-round action to break or disentangle itself with a DC 13 Strength check or a DC 13 Escape Artist check.
Large or larger creatures are too big to be captured or impeded by the bands.
Material Component: Three small silver hoops, interlocked.
