You subtly change your appearance so that it seems particularly friendly to the viewer.
You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks made to influence or gain information from creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher, as long as those creatures aren't already hostile toward you.
This spell does not alter your appearance in any significant way, and thus provides no bonus on Disguise checks.
