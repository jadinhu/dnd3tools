You summon the spirit of a fiend from the depths of Hell or the Abyss and bind it into the body of a corporeal undead creature.
Both the undead creature and the fiend get a Will saving throw to negate the effects of vile death.
Some fiends may voluntarily fail the save if you swear to dismiss the effect after a certain task or an amount of time.
Similarly, some undead may voluntarily fail the save in order to gain the fiend's power, even temporarily.
Binding the fiend applies the fiendish template from the Monster Manual to the undead creature.
The resulting creature is independent of you, and may act on its own, and its initial attitude toward you is indifferent.
Arcane Material Component: A bit of brimstone.
