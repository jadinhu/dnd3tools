You cause a Fine item in your possession to fly at great speed to a target or location you specify.
The spell protects the item from any damage caused by this launching (for example, an egg would not crack from being hurled by the spell, a flask of alchemist's fire would not break from the sudden acceleration) but does not protect it from damage caused by striking the target.
This spell is normally used to launch dangerous items (flasks of acid, thunderstones, and so on) farther than you could normally throw them.
Even strange magical effects (such as the glowing bead from a delayed blast fireball spell) can be safely launched by this spell.
