When you cast this spell, you flick a silk scarf at one creature within range, magically propelling it toward the target.
The scarf assumes an ironlike hardness on the way.
You must have line of sight to the target and hit with a normal ranged attack with the scarf.
If you hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
Focus: The silk scarf.
