Your hands glow softly, as if illuminated from within by a bright light.
This spell adds a touch of good to your magic, granting you special potency against your evil-aligned enemies.
Your spells gain the good descriptor.
Any spell you cast of 3rd level or lower deals +50% damage to evil-aligned creatures.
As part of the casting of this spell, you can sacrifice one sorcerer spell slot of 5th to 9th level; doing this increases the maximumlevel of spells affected by mark of the enlightened soul to the level of the sacrificed slot minus 1.
For example, if you spend a 4th-level spell slot to cast the spell and a 7th-level spell slot to augment it, you would deal extra damage to evil-aligned creatures with spells of 6th level or lower.
Special: A good-aligned caster of the dragonblood subtype can choose to end this spell's duration by activating protection from evil (as the spell, but targeting itself) as a swift action.
This effect lasts for the normal duration of protection from evil.
