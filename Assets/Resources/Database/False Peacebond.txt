<b>False Peacebond</b>(CityScape)

Transmutation
 <b>Level:</b>  Assassin 1,  Blackguard 1,  Sorcerer 2,  Wizard 2,    
<b>Components:</b>

 	
The weapon glows with a faint aura.
For just a moment, your companion shimmers to match, before the light fades.
This spell functions as peacebond (see the facing page), except that you can choose a single individual who can draw the weapon freely.
This individual might be yourself, or anyone else present at the time of casting.
Once this individual draws the weapon, the false peacebond
effect ends; resheathing the weapon does not reactivate the spell.
