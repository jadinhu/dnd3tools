A deafening blast of sound, louder than thunder and more piercing that the shrieks of the damned, erupts where you point.
All creatures in the area are permanently deafened.
A successful Fortitude save reduces the duration of the deafness to 1 round.
If a subject is already under the effect of painful echoes (page 112) when attacked by deafening blast, the two spells interact to create a greater effect.
In addition to being deafened on a failed save, the subject is stunned for 1 round.
