One of your arms transforms into a retractable, rubbery appendage ending in a taloned claw.
You can attack with this claw as if your natural reach were 5 feet longer than it is.
(Thus, the spell provides a 10-foot natural reach for most Medium casters).
You gain a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls with the black talon, and this bonus increases by 1 per four caster levels (to +2 at 5th level, +3 at 9th level, and so forth).
The talon deals 1d6 points of slashing damage +1 point of negative energy damage per caster level (maximum +10).
A successful Will save reduces the negative energy damage by half.
You can also use the talon to make touch attacks, and the profane bonus on attack rolls applies to these as well.
A successful touch attack deals only the negative energy damage.
As with similar effects, the negative energy damage from this spell heals undead creatures.
