A scintillating aura of white radiance wreathes you and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee.
The radiance also protects you fromelectricity attacks.
Any creature striking you with a natural or handheld weapons deals normal damage but also takes 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point per caster level (the creature's spell resistance applies).
You take only half damage from electricity-based attacks.
If an electricity-based attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
The radiance is as bright as a light spell, casting bright light in a 10-foot radius and shadowy illumination to 20 feet.
Abstinence Component: You must not have cast a darkness or Necromancy spell within the last 24 hours before casting this spell.
