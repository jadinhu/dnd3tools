This spell transforms a volume of water into an equal volume of ingested poison.
The saving throw DC of the poison is the same as the spell's DC would be (15 + your Intelligence modifier).
The poison's initial damage is 1 point of temporary Constitution damage, and its secondary damage is 1d8 points of temporary Constitution damage.
A single swallow of poison is enough to cause this effect, but drinking more does not increase the effect.
Material Component: The fang of a poisonous snake.
