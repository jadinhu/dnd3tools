This spell creates an aura of shimmering blue-white light similar to moonlight that fills your space and moves with you.
The aura sheds light equal to a candle.
This aura functions like a lesser globe of invulnerability.
If you are a sorcerer and SelÃ»ne is your patron, the aura also grants you the benefit of protection from evil.
The spell is named for the Shards, planetar servants of SelÃ»ne drawn from the ranks of her greatest priestesses.
Because some shards return to FaerÃ»n to visit their mortal lovers, supernatural bloodlines (usually aasimar, but not always) with ties to SelÃ»ne exist in some parts of the world.
Material Component: A moonstone or other polished white stone.
