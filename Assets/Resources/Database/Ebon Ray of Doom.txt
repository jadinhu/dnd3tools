You fire a ray of black energy that drastically slows down the rate at which the subject can recover hit points.
Any creature attempting to restore hit points to the subject by means of any sort of healing magic must succeed on a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level), or the healing effect fails.
A subject with fast healing or a regeneration ability must make a Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn each round.
Failure indicates that the ability does not function in that round.
