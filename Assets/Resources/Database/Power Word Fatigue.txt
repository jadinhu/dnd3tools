With a syllable, you sap vigor from your target.
You utter a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of your choice to become fatigued, whether the creature can hear the word or not.
(A fatigued creature instead becomes exhausted for the spell's duration, then reverts to being fatigued).
The duration of the spell depends on the target's current hit point total, as shown below.
Any creature that currently has 101 or more hit points is unaffected by power word fatigue.
