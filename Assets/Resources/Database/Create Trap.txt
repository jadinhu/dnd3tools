You throw a small gear, and when it hits the ground a trap springs up at the place you designate.
You create a CR 1 trap selected from the following list: basic arrow trap, fusillade of darts, scything blade trap, or spear trap (<span class="caps">DMG</span> 70-71).
You can locate the 5-foot-by-5-foot trigger in any square of your choice within the range of this spell.
