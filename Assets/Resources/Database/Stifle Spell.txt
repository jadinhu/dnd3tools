As the creature casts a spell, you utter a simple magical phrase that momentarily confounds it.
You cast this spell to distract another creature as it attempts to cast a spell.
The target must succeed on a Concentration check (DC equal to 14 + your key ability modifier + the level of the spell being cast) to ignore the distraction, or else it loses the spell.
