Tiny pinpricks tingle over your entire body as if a swarm of needles is trying to emerge from beneath your flesh.
As you complete the incantation, daggerlike shards of force burst forth from your skin.
You create a brief maelstrom of daggerlike, flying darts of force that spin, slice, and rebound within the area.
All within the area take 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
The name is a misnomer, since the spell creates neither steel nor a true sting.
Origin: This spell was created decades ago by Rythtalies of Amn, who patterned it after the blade barrier spell employed by a cleric of Bhaal.
He then taught it to Jalanvaloss.
