While you are in this stance, you can walk up to 5 feet above the ground. Your speed becomes 20 feet while you are in this stance, and you cannot run. You ignore any terrain feature that fails to project more than 5 feet above the ground, such as difficult terrain, burning lava, water, and so forth. In addition, you ignore the standard penalties on Hide and Move Silently checks for moving quickly.
