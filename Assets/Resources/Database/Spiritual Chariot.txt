When this spell is cast, a ghostly chariot forms behind the paladin's special mount.
The chariot is large and ornate, and it is made of transparent, faintly glowing energy.
Usually the holy symbol of the paladin's deity is emblazoned on the sides of the chariot.
The mount is correctly harnessed to the chariot.
The chariot can hold 1 Medium creature or two Small creatures plus the driver (usually the paladin).
Although the chariot seems large and sturdy, it and its occupants have no weight for the purpose of the mount's load, so the horse can travel at full speed.
If the chariot is ever unhitched from the special mount, it disappears.
The driver of the spiritual chariot gains a +4 sacred bonus on her Handle Animal checks.
The chariot is made of magical force and is immune to damage.
It interacts with other spells just like a wall of force.
Those in the chariot have cover based on their size and the position of their attackers.
In most situations, Medium creatures inside the chariot gain cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws).
