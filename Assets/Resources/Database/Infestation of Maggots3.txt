<b>You touch your foe with the dust of dead flies on your fingers, giving birth to hundreds of writhing maggots in his flesh.</b>
	
With a successful melee touch attack, you infest a creature with maggotlike creatures. If the touched creature fails a Fortitude saving throw, the magical maggots deal 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round at the beginning of your turn. The subject makes a new Fortitude save each round to negate the damage in that round and end the effect.
The infestation can be removed with a remove disease or heal spell.
