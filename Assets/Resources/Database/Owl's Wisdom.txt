The transmuted creature becomes wiser.
The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills.
Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive owl's wisdom do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells increase.
Arcane Material Component: A few feathers, or a pinch of droppings, from an owl.
