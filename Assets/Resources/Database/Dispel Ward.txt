This spell functions like <b>dispel magic</b> (<b>PH</b> 223), except that it can be used only in the targeted or area version, and it affects only abjuration magic placed upon objects or areas (such as <b>arcane lock</b>, <b>explosive runes</b>, <b>fire trap</b>, <b>glyph of warding</b>, and <b>guards and wards</b>.) The maximum bonus on the level check is +10.
