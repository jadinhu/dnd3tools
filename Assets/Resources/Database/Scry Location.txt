At the culmination of this long ritual, you gaze into your scrying focus and stretch out your sight.
The mists within the reflective surface dissipate, and suddenly you can see and hear a familiar place.
You can see and hear what occurs at a location, which can be at any distance on the same plane where you are located.
You must make a successful caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) to scry a specific location.
The difficulty of this check depends on how familiar you are with that location and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that place.
Furthermore, the difficulty to scry the desired locale increases if the location is extremely far removed, indoors or underground, or on another plane.
The DC of this check is 20 + any modifiers related to your knowledge of the area, your connection to it, and the location's distance, as set out in the following table.
If you fail this check, the scrying attempt simply fails.
If the caster level check succeeds, you create an invisible magical sensor in any location you desire.
Through this sensor you can both see and hear, your vantage and range of vision being the same as if you were actually at that place, allowing you to make Spot and Listen checks as normal.
You can rotate the sensor as you wish, seeing in any direction you desire.
Once the spell is cast, however, you cannot change the position of the sensor.
As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects.
In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message.
If the caster level check fails, you can't attempt to scry on any place within 1 mile of that location until 24 hours have passed.
