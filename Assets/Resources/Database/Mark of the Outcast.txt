This spell creates an indelible mark on the subject's face (or other upper body part, if the subject doesn't have a head). The mark is visible to normal vision, low-light vision, and darkvision. The wearer of such a mark takes a -5 circumstance penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks and a -2 penalty to Armor Class.
	
The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.
