Your hand shrivels like the limb of a corpse as dark energy flows through your veins.
You bestow on your target a horrible disease effectively identical to mummy rot.
The incubation period is instantaneous, and the initial save for the spell is calculated normally; all subsequent daily saves to avoid damage are DC 20.
Mummy rot deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage immediately, and a similar amount per day thereafter; a victim reduced to 0 Constitution shrivels away into sand and dust.
Furthermore, any character attempting to cast any healing spell on a creature afflicted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has no effect.
Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot can't be overcome through natural methods or successful saves.
To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with break enchantment, remove curse, or a similar effect (requiring a DC 20 caster level check).
If this is done, a caster level check is no longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and mummy rot can be magically cured like any disease.
