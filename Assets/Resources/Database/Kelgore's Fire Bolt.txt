You conjure a shard of red-hot rock and hurl it toward an
opponent.
As it streaks through the air, a nimbus of arcane energy crackles around it.
This spell conjures a small orb of rock and sheathes it in arcane energy.
This spell deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d6).
If you fail to overcome the target's spell resistance, the spell still deals 1d6 points of fire damage from the heat and force of the conjured orb's impact.
Material Component: A handful of ashes.
