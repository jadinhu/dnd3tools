<b>From your hiding place, you whisper the spell softly, your words taking on a sonorous drone. One by one, your foes drop to ground, asleep.</b>
	
The targets of this spell fall into a comatose slumber. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding the subjects awakens them, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action.
