<b>You invoke the mighty powers of the earth and it rises about you, limning you from below with brilliant green radiance. The power surges within your hands as you are invested with its might, and you bend that might to your own will.</b>
	
You take up the mantle of the earth, gaining power over it as long as you stand upon or beneath its surface. While energized with the awesome power of this spell, you can choose a spell from those listed below once per round and use it as a spelllike ability.
