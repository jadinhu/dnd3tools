<b>Components:</b>

 <b>Range:</b> Melee attack

<b>Your weapon becomes a blur of motion as you swing it in a tight arc over your head. Once you build up enough speed, you explode into a sweeping attack that chops into the enemies around you.</b>
	
When you initiate this strike, you make a melee attack against every opponent adjacent to you. Resolve each attack separately. You gain a +2 bonus on each of these attacks, which are otherwise made at your highest attack bonus.
