This spell rips apart the soulmelds shaped on a particular creature, unshaping them in a burst of scattered incarnum.
Make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +25) against each of the soulmelds shaped on the chosen creature (against a DC of 11 + meldshaper level), starting with the soulmeld with the highest essentia investment (break ties randomly).
Add +4 to the DC if the soulmeld is bound to a chakra.
Essentia invested in unshaped soulmelds returns to its owner's essentia pool.
