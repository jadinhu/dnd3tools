This spell is similar to darkness, except that those within the area of darkness also take unholy damage.
Creatures of good alignment take 2d6 points of damage per round in the darkness, and creatures neither good nor evil take 1d6 points of damage.
As with the darkness spell, the area of the darkness is a 20-foot radius, and the object that serves as the spell's target can be shrouded to block the darkness (and thus the damaging effect).
Damning darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
Spell resistance applies to the damage dealt by this spell but not to the darkness area.
Arcane Material Component: A dollop of pitch with a tiny needle hidden inside it.
