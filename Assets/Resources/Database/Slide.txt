You slide the subject creature along the ground a distance of 5 feet in any direction.
(If the creature is flying or otherwise not on the ground, it moves parallel to the ground).
You can't slide the subject into a space that is occupied by an ally, an enemy, or a solid object.
(If you attempt to slide the subject into such a space, the spell automatically ends).
You can slide the subject fast enough to clear small gaps in the ground, such as narrow pits.
You cannot slide the subject up or down, but you can slide it over the edge of a cliff or the like.
This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
