<b>Prying Eyes, Greater</b>(Player's Handbook v.3.5, p. 267)

Divination
 <b>Level:</b>  Sorcerer 8,  Wizard 8,  Sha'ir 8,    
<b>Components:</b>

 	
This spell functions like prying eyes, except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had true seeing with a range of 120 feet.
Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at full normal speed.
Also, a greater prying eye's maximum Spot modifier is +25 instead of +15.
