<b>Radiating out from your hands, moss and ivy covers your flesh until you resemble a shambling mound.</b>
	
You imbue yourself with powerful transformative magic, gaining some of the characteristics of the plant type. Any spell or effect that would affect plant creatures also affects you, for the duration of plant body.
	
When subject to this spell, you are immune to extra damage from critical hits, mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing.
	
Your ability scores, skills, and feats are unaffected (although your new form might make it difficult or impossible for you to use certain skills or feats).
