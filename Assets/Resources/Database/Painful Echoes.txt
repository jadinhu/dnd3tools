Your shout seems to echo into eternity, causing your foes to twitch and writhe as the reverberations pummel them internally.
You set up painful vibrations within your subjects.
Each round, the spell deals 1d4 points of sonic damage and sickens each subject for 1 round.
A successful Fortitude save negates the damage and the sickening effect for that round, but the subject must continue to save every round until the duration expires.
Creatures that are immune to extra damage from critical hits are immune to the sickening effect.
If a subject under the effect of painful echoes is affected by deafening blast (see page 101) or resonating agony (see page 115), the two spells interact to create a greater effect.
See the deafening blast and resonating agony spells for details.
