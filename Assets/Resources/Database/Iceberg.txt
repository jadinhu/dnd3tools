Iceberg is a brutal and direct spell.
When cast, the spell creates a single large block of ice that drops from the sky onto a spot you select.
The iceberg then shatters if it encounters a solid surface.
Elephant-sized blocks of ice scatter in all directions, affecting nearby creatures based on how far they are from the center of the area.
Within 20 Feet of the Center Point: Any creature or object directly beneath the iceberg takes 20d6 points of crushing damage (no save) and is buried in snow (see page 90).
Between 20 Feet and 40 Feet of the Center Point: Creatures and objects in the middle section of the area also take 20d6 points of crushing damage, but are entitled to a Reflex save for half damage.
They are buried in snow (see page 90).
Between 40 Feet and 60 Feet of the Center Point: Creatures in the outermost section may be struck by flying debris for 10d6 points of damage.
They are entitled to a Reflex save for half damage, and are not buried regardless of whether the saving throw is successful or not.
