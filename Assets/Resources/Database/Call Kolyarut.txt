By casting this spell, you request the aid of a kolyarut inevitable.
If you know an individual kolyarut's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway).
You may ask the kolyarut to perform one duty for you.
The task must be in harmony with its lawful objective, and must take no more than seven days to complete.
Kolyaruts mete out punishment to those who break bargains and oaths.
The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task.
After seven days, or if asked to do something nonlawful, frivolous, or not focused on its lawful objective, the kolyarut will leave.
XP Cost: 250 XP.
