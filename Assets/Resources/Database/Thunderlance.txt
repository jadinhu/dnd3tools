A faint, gray, shimmering force in the general shape of a staff or spear springs from your hand.
You can freely make the force retract or grow to any size from 1 foot to 20 feet, but it always remains a straight lance of force.
This gives you natural reach of 20 feet.
You can use the thunderlance to make powerful melee attacks.
The thunderlance strikes as a Huge longspear, dealing a base 2d6 points of damage (crit x3).
You only need one hand to wield the thunderlance, and you suffer no nonproficiency penalties if you do not have Martial Weapon Proficiency (longspear).
The thunderlance strikes with a Strength score equal to 12 + your caster level (maximum +15) which replaces your own Strength score when you make attack and damage rolls with the spell.
If you successfully strike a target protected by any force effect of 3rd level or lower, such as a shield or mage armor spell, the thunderlance may dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target.
Make a dispel check against the caster who created the effect.
If you succeed, the effect is dispelled.
The thunderlance remains whether you succeed or fail at this check.
You can choose to attack objects or to use the Strength score of the thunderlance for Strength scores involving breaking or damaging items.
Material Component: A small metal spear.
