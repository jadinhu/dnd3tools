You fire a black ray of negative energy at a single target.
You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike your target.
A creature struck by this ray takes 3d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (up to +20).
The spell has no effect on constructs or inanimate objects.
Since undead are powered negative energy, this spell cures them of a like amount of damage, rather than harming them.
