Your holy symbol gleams with a bright, white light that seems to cleanse the air around you of the foul stench emanating from your undead enemies.
When you cast this spell on your holy symbol, your turning damage increases by 1d6 per four divine caster levels you possess (maximum +5d6) on your next successful turning check.
