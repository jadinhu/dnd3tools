Your bold shout bolsters the resolve of your allies.
When you cast battlecry, you and your allies gain a burst of confidence and combat prowess.
The next single attack made by any affected creature gains a +5 morale bonus on the damage roll, provided the attack is made before the end of your next turn.
This bonus applies only to a single attack.
In addition, any ally who is currently under a charm, compulsion, or fear effect can attempt a new save against that effect with a +2 morale bonus.

If an ally is under the effect of more than one of these, all durations are extended.
