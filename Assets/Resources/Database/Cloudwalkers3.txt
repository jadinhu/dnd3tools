<b>With a kiss blown to each subject, you create gaseous pads of cloudstuff on their feet, allowing them to walk on the clouds.</b>
	
Each subject of the spell can move with a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability), but only outdoors. To touch the earth again, a subject must use a standard action to shake off the cloudstuff, which ends the spell for that creature. You can dismiss the spell, but only for all subjects at once ï¿½ ;an act that can have significant consequences for subjects already in the air.
