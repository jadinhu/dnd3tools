You call upon the mother cyst that your body hosts, drawing from it strength, vigor, speed, and vicious certainty.
While the spell is in effect, you gain a +8 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom, a +8 natural armor bonus to Armor Class as your skin briefly crusts and hardens, a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and 100 temporary hit points.
While the empowerment lasts, you are unable to cast any other mother cyst feat-enabled spell.
Focus: Caster must possess a mother cyst (see page 28).
