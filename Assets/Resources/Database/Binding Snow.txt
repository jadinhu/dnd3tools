This spell must be cast on a snow field.
That snow field instantly freezes, impeding movement through the area.
A creature caught within the area can move only at half its normal speed.
By making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check, the creature can move at its normal speed for that round.
A creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not impeded.
