This spell summons a pride of celestial lions from the Wilderness of the Beastlands.
When the spell is complete, 2d4 celestial lions appear.
Ten minutes later, 1d4 celestial dire lions appear.
Each creature has maximum hit points per Hit Die.
Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.
The creatures obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them.
You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the creatures.
You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.
