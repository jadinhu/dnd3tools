A magical shard of ice blasts from your hand and speeds to its target.
You must succeed on a normal ranged attack to hit (with a +2 bonus on the attack roll for every two caster levels).
If it hits, an ice knife deals 2d8 points of cold damage plus 2 points of Dexterity damage (no Dexterity damage on a successful Fortitude save).
Creatures that have immunity to cold damage also take no Dexterity damage automatically.
A knife that misses creates a shower of ice crystals in a 10-foot-radius burst (see Missing with a Thrown Weapon, page 158 of the Player's Handbook, to determine where the shard hits).
The icy burst deals 1d8 points of cold damage to all creatures within the area of the effect (Reflex half).
Material Component: A drop of water or piece of ice.
