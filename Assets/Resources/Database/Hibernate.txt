You put a creature into a state of suspended animation, slowing its life functions to almost imperceptible levels and allowing a creature to survive for weeks without food or water.
This suspension of life functions automatically stabilizes a dying creature, and it can save starving or dehydrated creatures from death.
Creatures affected by a hibernate spell have a slower metabolism, healing wounds at a rate of just 1 hit point per level per week.
If the target is unwilling, it is entitled a Will saving throw.
A successful saving throw negates the effect of the spell; a failure allows the target an additional saving throw whenever it takes damage, when it is splashed with water or other liquids, or when 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.
