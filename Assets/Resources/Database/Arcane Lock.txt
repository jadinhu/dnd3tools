An arcane lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it.
You can freely pass your own arcane lock without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful dispel magic or knock spell.
Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell.
(A knock spell does not remove an arcane lock; it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes).
Material Component: Gold dust worth 25 gp.
