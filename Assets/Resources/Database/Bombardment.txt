You cause a rain of rocks to fall from the sky, burying your opponents.
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8) and buries any target who fails his save.
Buried subjects suffocate (see Suffocation, page 88 of the <span class="caps">DUNGEON</span> MASTER's Guide) until they climb from under the rocks (this is a full-round action).
A buried creature has nine-tenths cover and concealment.
Focus: A quartz crystal embedded in rock.
