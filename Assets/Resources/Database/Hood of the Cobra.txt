In the mind of your victim, the hood of a king cobra spreads from your head, neck, and back, your eyes become those of a great serpent, and dripping fangs sprout from your jaws.
The subject perceives that you have grown serpentine features, including a cobra's hood, a snake's slitted eyes, and venomous fangs.
A successful Will save allows him to recognize the illusion as unreal, which ends the spell's effect.
However, if the Will save fails, the subject is shaken for as long as he can see you.
Closing his eyes negates this effect but also effectively blinds him.
In addition, if you make a successful melee touch attack (a standard action) against the target while the spell's duration lasts, he believes that he has been bitten by a venomous serpent and takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage (Fortitude negates).
Unlike normal poison, this attack has no secondary damage, though you can continue to &quot;bite&quot; the subject each round.
Immunity or resistance to poison applies normally against this effect, even though it isn't real poison (the subject and his body both believe it to be real).
