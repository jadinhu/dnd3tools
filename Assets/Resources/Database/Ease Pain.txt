Ease pain immediately removes any lingering effects of pain, including penalties imposed by symbol of pain, angry ache, and similar spells.
It does not heal any damage or other effects not directly related to pain.
If the target creature is under some effect that causes continuing damage, the pain is eased only for a moment.
Ease pain cannot bypass the need for a Concentration check to cast a spell under such circumstances, nor can it allow a creature subject to death by thorns to act normally (since the spell's damage is ongoing).
