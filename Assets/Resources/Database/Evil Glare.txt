This spell, inspired by the malevolent gaze of the shadowy nightwalkers, causes your eyes to glow with dark energy.
Immediately upon completion of the spell, you may target a living creature within range with your glare; that creature becomes paralyzed with fear for 1d8 rounds.
You must be able to see the creature, and it must be able to see you (though it need not meet your gaze).
Once per round after that for the duration of the spell, you can target another creature with your glare as a move action.
You can't target the same creature twice with a single casting of the spell, regardless of the success of its saves.
