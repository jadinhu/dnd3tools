<b>By chopping your hand like an axe and uttering the last few phrases of the spell, you cause the weapon you've touched to become wreathed in flickering blue flames.</b>
	
The flames from this spell shed azure light out to 30 feet. These flames do not harm the weapon or its wielder, but for the duration of the spell, it delivers fire damage in addition to its normal damage.
