Two clawed arms grow out of the subject's body.
The arms are roughly humanoid, but are either scaly or furred and end in sharp talons.
The spell transforms any clothing or armor worn by the creature to accommodate these additional arms; when the duration ends the creature's clothing and armor return to normal.
The arms grant the subject two primary claw attacks.
A hit from one of the claws deals slashing damage equal to 1d6 points (1d4 if Small) plus the creature's Strength modifier.
The claws cannot be used to wield weapons or manipulate objects.
Since the claws are primary attacks, you can attack with them in addition to making your weapon attacks without penalty.
The claws count as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
If both claw attacks hit the same target, the arms can rend the target for extra damage equal to 2d6 points plus 1-1/2 times the subject's Strength modifier.
Multiple castings of arms of plenty on a creature do not stack; the duration simply resets.
Material Component: A xill's claw.
