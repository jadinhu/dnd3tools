<b>Crackling emerald flames wreathe your hand as you finish the spell, lighting the area around you in a green glow.</b>
	
One of your hands bursts into an aura of brilliant emerald flame, shedding light equal to that of a torch. With a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack that deals 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The creature you touch is engulfed by the fiercely hot aura of flame. Each round at the beginning of its turn, the creature is allowed a Fortitude save to prevent further damage, but on a failed save the creature is still engulfed in the flaming aura and again takes 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
	
An engulfed creature that fails its Fortitude save can use a full-round action to attempt a DC 15 Reflex save, which extinguishes the flames and ends the spell.
	
You can use this spell to attack an object. Nonmagical, unattended objects are automatically engulfed in green flame and take 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level each round.
