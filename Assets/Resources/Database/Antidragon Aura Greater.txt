A phosphorescent green aura bursts from you, causing an area 20 feet around you to glow brightly.
This spell creates a phosphorescent aura of protection around the subjects.
This abjuration has four effects, as follows:
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves.
This benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by dragons and dragonblood creatures.
Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against spells cast by dragons and dragonblood creatures.
Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, in the same manner as protection from evil.
Fourth, if a dragon or dragonblood creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (Fortitude save negates).
Focus: A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a shard from the sword of a famous dragon slayer.
The reliquary must be worth at least 500 gp.
Special: Members of the dragonslayer prestige class cast this spell at +1 caster level.
