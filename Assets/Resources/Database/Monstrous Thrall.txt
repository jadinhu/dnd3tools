As true domination, except the subject can be any creature and is permanently dominated if it fails its initial Will save.
A subject ordered to take an action against its nature receives a saving throw with a -4 penalty to resist taking that particular action.
If the save succeeds, the subject still remains your thrall despite its minor mutiny.
Once a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty.
XP Cost: 500 XP per Hit Die or level of the subject.
