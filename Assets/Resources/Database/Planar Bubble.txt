This spell creates an area around the target creature that emulates its native planar environment.
Thus, a character hailing from the Material Plane would have normal gravity, temperature, magic, and so on.
This spell cast on a native of the Plane of Shadow would make the area around her have normal gravity, a mild neutral alignment, enhanced shadow spells, and impeded light spells.
