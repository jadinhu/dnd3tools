<b>Cupping a hand to your mouth, you howl like a wolf, and in a moment, mist coalesces into a wolflike form with terrible jaws.</b>
	
You conjure forth an incorporeal white wolf with abnormally large, frosty jaws. This phantom wolf follows your mental commands, acting on your behalf as long as it remains within range and you continue to concentrate on it.
	
A phantom wolf appears where you designate and acts as you direct on your turn. You don't need to maintain line of effect once the spell is cast, but the spell ends if the phantom wolf is ever outside the spell's range.
