This spell functions like Otiluke's resilient sphere, except that the sphere painfully constricts the target, hampering her movements and breathing.
The target is entangled and takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage per round as the sphere contracts.
If the target is rendered unconscious, any remaining damage from the crushing sphere is lethal damage.
Material Component: An eggshell, which is crushed as the spell is cast.
