You create water in the lungs of the subject, causing it to begin drowning.
The subject's hit points immediately drop to 0, and it falls unconscious.
In the next round, it loses another hit point (bringing its hp to -1) and is dying.
In the following round, it dies.
(For details on drowning, see the Drowning rule in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Coughing and other attempts by the subject to physically expel the water from its lungs are useless.
However, another creature can stabilize the subject with a DC 15 Heal check before death.
Undead, constructs, creatures that do not need to breathe, and creatures that can breathe water are unaffected by this spell.
