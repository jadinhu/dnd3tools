<b>You leap into the air, catching a larger opponent by surprise as you jump over its defenses to plunge your weapon into the crown of its head.</b>
	
With a carefully timed leap, you jump over the target?s defenses and attack it from an unexpected angle. You can use this maneuver only against a foe of a larger size category than yours. As part of this maneuver, you make a Jump check with a DC equal to your foe?s AC. If this check succeeds, you also make a melee attack as part of this maneuver. If the check fails, you cannot make this attack and the maneuver is still considered expended. You gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll and deal an extra 6d6 points of damage if your attack hits.</
