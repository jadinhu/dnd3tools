You temporarily boost the number of tricks that an animal knows.
While this spell is in effect, the affected animal gains a number of additional tricks equal to half your caster level (maximum five).
For more information on tricks and trained animals, see the descriptions of the Handle Animal skill, page 100 of this book, and pages 74-75 of the Player's Handbook.
This spell does not modify an animal's attitude toward you, nor does it guarantee that an animal will cooperate when instructed to perform the newly learned tricks.
