This spell grants you the ability to make one ray attack per round.
The ray dazes one living creature, clouding its mind so that it takes no action for 1d3 rounds.
The creature is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.
