The subject contracts an affliction selected from the list below, which strikes immediately (no incubation period).
Afflictions deal damage only to evil creatures.
Any evil creature takes damage equal to that listed plus its Charisma bonus.
An evil elemental or evil undead takes an extra 1 point of damage, and an evil outsider or an evil cleric of an evil deity takes an extra 2 points.
The DC listed is for the subsequent saves (use affliction's normal save DC for the initial saving throw).
