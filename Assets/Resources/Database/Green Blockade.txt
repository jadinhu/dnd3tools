You raise a barrier of plant life before you.
Any creature trying to pass through this blockade must succeed at a Strength check (DC 15) to do so; success ends its movement on the other side of the wall.
Fire burns away the blockade in 1 round, or creatures with appropriate implements can chop through it in 1 minute.
