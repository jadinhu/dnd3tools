This spell causes a color pool on the Astral Plane (<b>DMG</b> 154) � ;an irregular patch of color containing a portal to another plane � ;to seemingly cease to exist. In truth, the color pool is only hidden from view. The use of this spell does not hide the area around the pool; it masks only the fact that a pool is present. &quot;<b>See invisibility</b>&quot;: spells/players-handbook-v35 � ;6/see-invisibility � ;2514/or <b>true seeing</b> reveals the presence of the pool, as does <b>analyze portal</b>.
