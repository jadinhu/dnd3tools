You bring the forces of erosion to bear on a fabricated structure such as a stone bridge, a wooden building, an iron wall, a construct, or any other object not formed by nature itself.
The erosion inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the object (hardness does not apply) to a maximum of 15d6.
This spell does not affect living creatures.
It does, however, affect constructs.
The maximum size of the object affected depends on your level.
If you cast this spell on an object of greater size than you can affect, the spell fails.
