Magical force grips the subject's heart (or similar vital organ) and begins crushing it.
The victim reacts as if having a heart attack (it is paralyzed) and takes 1d3 points of damage per round.

A conscious victim gains a new saving throw each round to end the spell.
If the victim dies as a result of this spell, its smoking heart appears in the caster's hand.
