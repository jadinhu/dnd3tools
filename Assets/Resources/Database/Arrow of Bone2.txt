When thrown or fired at a creature as a normal ranged attack, the weapon gains a +4 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. In addition, any living creature struck by an arrow of bone must succeed on a Fortitude save or be instantly slain. A creature that makes its save instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Regardless of whether the attack hits, the magic of the arrow of bone is discharged by the attack, and the missile is destroyed.
