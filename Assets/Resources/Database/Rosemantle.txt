You cause the target to glow with a soft, faint, rosy radiance equal to candlelight.
This glow protects the target against effects that work by directly causing pain (such as Nybor's gentle reminder), nausea, and fear effects by granting a +1 sacred bonus per caster level (up to +10) on saving throws against those spells and effects.
The target also becomes temporarily immune to poison (as the delay poison spell).
This spell only suppresses these effects, not negates them, so the effects resume when this spell expires.
