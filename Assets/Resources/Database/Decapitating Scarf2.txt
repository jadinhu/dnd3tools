<b>Decapitating Scarf</b>(Oriental Adventures)

Transmutation
 <b>Level:</b>  Wu Jen 7 (Metal),    
<b>Components:</b>
 <b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial

 	
As iron scarf, but if you succeed with your ranged attack roll, the scarf wraps around the target's neck.
The target may then attempt a Fortitude saving throw; failure indicates that you are able to yank the scarf and decapitate the victim.
This spell works only against creatures with heads, and decapitation is only effective against living creatures (except vampires).
Oozes and many aberrations have no heads and are thus immune to this spell.
Constructs and most undead are not harmed by the removal of their heads, so the spell is ineffective against them.
Living creatures that make successful Fortitude saves take 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d4) before freeing themselves from the decapitating scarf.
