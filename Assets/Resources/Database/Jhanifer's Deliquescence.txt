As transmute rock to mud, except it transforms ice to cold water (about 40Â° F).
The water remains until a successful dispel magic spell or spell with the cold descriptor restores its substance � ;but not necessarily its form.
The water will freeze again naturally depending on local weather conditions and the depth of the water, normally over the course of several hours or days.
This spell was created by SylunÃ© in her guise as Jhanifer.</p
