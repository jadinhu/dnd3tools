You cause one creature to burst into flames.
The target of the inferno takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and its clothing, items, hair, and flesh burn with ferocity.
In each round thereafter, the fire deals 1d6 fewer points of damage (minimum 1d6) until the spell ends or the subject manages to extinguish the flames.
Thus, the fire deals 5d6 points of damage in the second round, 4d6 points in the third round, and so forth.
Flammable, nonmagical items carried by the target automatically fail their saves to resist this damage.
After the first round, the target can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save as a full-round action to extinguish the flames before taking additional damage.
Rolling on the ground allows the target a +2 bonus on this save.
Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically ends the effect.
Material Component: A gob of beeswax.
