Your beard grows and turns to pure and magically hardened silver, increasing the armor bonus of your armor by +2.
An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants an AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.
If you do not have a beard, you grow one for the duration of this spell (even if you are a creature that cannot normally grow a beard, such as an elf or a female human).
You get a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against dwarves.
Repeated uses of this spell eventually result in your beard turning a natural silver color (if you cannot normally grow a beard, this secondary effect does not occur).
