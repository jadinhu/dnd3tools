Your touch causes horrible agony in a creature's vital area.
You lay your hand upon a creature and deal 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).
In addition, if you have the sneak attack ability, you also deal sneak attack damage to the affected creature unless the creature is immune to extra damage from critical hits.
The creature still takes the spell damage even if it does not take the sneak attack damage.
Unlike a normal use of sneak attack, your target need not be flanked or denied its Dexterity bonus to take sneak attack damage from this spell.
