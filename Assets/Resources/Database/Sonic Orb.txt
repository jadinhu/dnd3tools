As acid orb, except sonic orb deals sonic damage.
A creature struck directly takes the orb's damage and is deafened for 1 round.
A deafened creature cannot hear, suffers a -4 penalty to initiative checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components.
The creature cannot make Listen checks.
A successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half and negates the deafening effect.
