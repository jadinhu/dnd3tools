You place a protective magic upon your hand that allows you to touch an untriggered magic symbol such as a glyph of warding or a symbol.
The touched symbol is removed from its location and held as magical potential on your hand, like a touch spell.
To pick up the spell, you must make a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level).
Failure indicates the glyph or symbol has been triggered.
If successfully transferred, you can place the symbol on a surface (not a creature) appropriate to the stored spell as a standard action.
The transferred symbol works normally thereafter and retains all its original triggering conditions (although its current location may make its triggers difficult or impossible to achieve).
You can maintain the symbol in its potential state as long as you concentrate.
If your concentration lapses while the symbol is stored as potential, it immediately triggers upon you (and only you), even if you normally wouldn't meet the trigger conditions.
Saving throw and spell resistance rolls are as for the original symbol.
The only safe way to rid yourself of the stored spell is to place it on a suitable surface.
Focus: A piece of slate that has been scoured bare and smooth on one side.
