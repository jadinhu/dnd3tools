This spell allows you to spit a gout of flame in a 10-foot cone, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d6).
Palarandusk's fire breath is considered a breath weapon.
If you expend the spell on the round you cast it, you only use one standard action to cast and breathe.
If you save the spell for later, you must use a standard action to breathe fire.
If unused, the gout of flame dissipates after 1 hour.
One nasty side effect of this spell is terrible heartburn.
