Ambient song transforms the sounds needed to produce any bardic music effect into background noise.
Those who hear bardic music masked in this way remain unaware of its true nature, though it still has its normal effects.
For example, you could use this spell to make a song intended to inspire competence sound like the chirping of crickets, the rustling of leaves, or the crackling of the campfire.
You choose what your ambient song sounds like, but it should be a noise that's in harmony with the immediate environment.
A subject who makes a successful Will save realizes that the sound has been altered and can hear its true nature.
Material Component: A small bit of whatever naturally makes the sound you're trying to mimic.
For example, a cricket's leg, a dried leaf, or a charred twig would produce the ambient song effects mentioned above.
