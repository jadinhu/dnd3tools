When you cast this spell, you place an enchantment on a Large or larger wooden-hafted weapon (such as a bo, naginata, nunchaku, three-section staff, or similar weapon).
The next time that weapon is used to make a melee attack, its shaft twists around so that the weapon strikes the wielder instead.
The weapon's wielder makes a normal attack roll upon himself and deals normal damage if he hits.
He cannot choose to deal subdual damage or otherwise reduce the damage he deals, although any damage reduction he has still applies.
Once the attacker damages himself with the affected weapon, the spell is discharged.
Unattended magic weapons targeted by this spell receive a Will save; if successful, the spell has no effect.
See Attack an Object in the Player's Handbook for information concerning object saving throws.
Focus: A dagger.
