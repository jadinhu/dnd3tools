A moan precedes the transformation that results when you imbue the target with the baleful power of a narzugon.
You bind the dread essence of a narzugon to a target creature, filling it with the misery and horror that defines the devil's existence.
The subject of this spell can use a baleful gaze as a standard action.
The gaze affects a single creature within 20 feet.
That creature must succeed on a Will save against the spell's save DC or be immobilized for 1 round as if affected by a hold monster spell.
Baatezu are immune to this gaze attack.
Once a creature has successfully resisted this effect, it cannot be affected by this gaze from the same creature for 24 hours.
The subject also gains resistance to fire 10.
This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the narzugon).
While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.
After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.
Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.
