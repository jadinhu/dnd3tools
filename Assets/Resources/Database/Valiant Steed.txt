The caster calls a special servant of the exalted god Valarian � ;either a pegasus or unicorn � ;to her location.
The creature serves the caster for up to a year, during which time the caster may dismiss it at any time.
It is intelligent, so the caster can assign it complex tasks.
Although useful as a mount, it will not undertake a quest or otherwise take on complex burdens beyond the supervision of the caster.
If the caster attempts to conjure another creature using this spell, the one called previously returns to its home.
Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Strength drain.
