This spell is cast upon a single arrow or crossbow bolt, enabling it to strike two targets instead of one.
The character firing the arrow selects the two targets, both of which must be within 30 feet of each other, and makes a separate attack roll against each target (using the same attack bonus).
After striking or missing the first target, the arrow swerves and continues on course to the second target.
A doublestrike missile cannot hit the same target twice, and it is destroyed even if it misses its intended targets.
Material Component: Arrow or bolt.
