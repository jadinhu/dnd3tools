This spell summons 1d4+1 celestial (NG) or fiendish (NE) Huge monstrous spiders.
They appear where you designate and act immediately, on your turn.
They attack your opponents to the best of their ability.
If you can communicate with the spiders, you can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
When you use a summoning spell to summon an evil or good creature, it is a spell of that type.
