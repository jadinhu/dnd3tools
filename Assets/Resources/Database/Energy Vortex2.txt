<b>Components:</b>V, S, 
 <b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action
 <b>Range:</b> 20 ft.
 <b>Target:</b> All creatures within a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you
 <b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous

<b>Energy wells up inside you and explodes outward in a furious burst.</b>
	
When you cast energy vortex, you choose one of four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. A blast of that energy type bursts in all directions from you, dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20) to nearby creatures other than you. If you are willing to take the damage yourself, you deal twice as much damage. You don't get a Reflex save, but spell resistance applies, as do any resistances and immunities you have to the energy type.
	
The descriptor of this spell is the same as the energy type you choose when you cast it.
