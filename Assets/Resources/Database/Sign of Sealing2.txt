<b>While pointing at the target, you trace the lines of a complicated sigil that visually appears where it is to seal. The sigil glows with latent magical energy.</b>
	
You seal a door, chest, or similar closure with a prominent magical sigil that bars entry and prevents opening. A door or object protected by this spell can be opened only by breaking (add 10 to the normal break DC) or by the use of <b>knock</b> or <b>dispel magic</b>. If the door or object is forced open by any means (magical or physical), the sign of sealing deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) in a 30-foot radius (Reflex half).
	
A knock spell doesn't negate or automatically bypass a sign of sealing, but will suppress the sign for 10 minutes on a successful caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the sign's creator). A sign of sealing is a magic trap that can be disarmed with a DC 28 Disable Device check. You can pass your own sign safely, and it remains set behind you.
	
Material Component: A crushed emerald worth 100 gp.
