This spell soothes and quiets the subjects, rendering them docile and harmless.
Animals trained to attack or guard, dire animals, legendary animals, beasts, and magical beasts are entitled to saving throws against this effect; normal animals are not.
(A druid could calm a normal bear or wolf with little trouble, but it's more difficult to affect a winter wolf, a bulette, or a trained guard dog).
The subjects remain where they are and do not attack or flee.
They are not helpless, so they defend themselves normally if attacked.
Any threat (fire, a hungry predator, or an imminent attack, for example) breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.
