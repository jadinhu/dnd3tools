You instantly analyze the field of battle, visualizing lines of power connecting you and your allies to tactically viable positions.
With a shout, you cause those lines to pull taut.
This spell instantly teleports a number of willing creatures a short distance with no chance for mishap, as greater teleport.
Effectively, tactical teleportation lets you reposition a number of allies (including yourself, if you choose) around the battlefield.
Each creature to be affected must be within range of you, and no creature can be transported farther away from your original position than the range allows.
You must have line of sight to all the intended destinations when you cast the spell.
Each subject can bring along held or carried objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed the subject's maximum load.
Only objects held or in use (attended) by another individual receive saving throws and spell resistance.
If any subject would appear in a space occupied by another creature or a solid object, that subject is unaffected by the spell, but the rest of the effect resolves normally.
