Fanfare creates a trumpet blast so loud that it can shake the foundations of buildings or stop an army in its tracks.
Every creature within the area must make a Fortitude save.
Success means the creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds and deafened for twice as many rounds; failure means the creature takes 4d6 points of damage in addition to suffering those effects.
Any object made of glass, wood, stone, or metal within the cone takes 2d6 points of damage, ignoring hardness.
Material Component: A small, tin horn.
