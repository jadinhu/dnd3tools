When in the presence of a demon, the caster conjures a bebilith � ;a demon that hunts other demons � ;to kill or chase off the original demon.
This spell is a risky proposition, however.
To determine the effect of the spell, subtract the Hit Dice of the demon from 12 (the HD of the bebilith), add the result to a caster level check, and consult the above table.
If this spell is cast while not in the presence of a demon, the bebilith acts as if the caster level check result was a 10.
Material Component: A bit of demon's flesh and a lump of iron.
