Your mind seems to expand as a mystical sixth sense begins observing the target area.
This spell functions like alarm, except that you immediately know the type and number of creatures that triggered the spell.
This effect applies only to creatures that cross the boundary during the round in which the spell is triggered; creatures that come afterward are not automatically detected.
