You direct an invisible blast of force at a chosen target.
The blast is a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6).
In addition, a successful hit forces the target to make a Fortitude save or be knocked down (size and stability modifiers apply to the saving throw as if the spell were a bull rush).
