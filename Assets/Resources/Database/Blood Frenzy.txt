You enter a rage similar to, but less effective than, that of a barbarian.
Your rage gives you a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves.
You suffer a -1 penalty to AC.
The additional Constitution increases your hit points by 1 point/level, but these hit points go away when the spell ends.
Otherwise, the effect is identical with barbarian rage (see page 25 of the Player's Handbook).
You cannot use skills that require concentration or patience, and once the spell ends, you're fatigued for the duration of that encounter.
