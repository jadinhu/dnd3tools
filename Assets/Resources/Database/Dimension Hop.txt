Pale motes of light dance and swirl about your fingertips.
When you touch the creature, it disappears, leaves a cloud of motes in its wake, and reappears somewhere nearby.
You instantly teleport the subject creature a distance of 5 feet per two caster levels.
The destination must be an unoccupied space within line of sight.
