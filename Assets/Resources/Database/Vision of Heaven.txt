Your words allow the target creature the merest glimpse of the blessed joy of the SevenHeavens, spurring the target to a moment of regret for its evil deeds.
For 1 round, the target is dazed.
In addition, the creature is more susceptible to future redemption.
For the next 24 hours, the creature takes a -1 penalty on all Will saves related to redemption (see Chapter 2).
