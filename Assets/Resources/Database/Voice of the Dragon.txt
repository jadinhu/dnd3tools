You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on your Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.
You also gain the ability to speak and understand (but not read) Draconic.
At any time before the spell's duration expires, you can use a standard action to target a creature with a suggestion effect, which functions identically to the spell of that name (including range, duration, and other effects).
Doing this causes the voice of the dragon spell to end, though the suggestion itself lasts for the normal duration thereafter.
Special: Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.
