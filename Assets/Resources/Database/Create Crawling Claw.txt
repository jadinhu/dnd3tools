You may create a number of crawling claws up to twice your caster level.
The hands to be transformed must all be within a 5-footradius circle.
To begin the spell, you must cast magic circle against good around yourself and the claws.
The magic circle need not endure throughout the create crawling claw spell's 1-hour casting time; simply initiating the spell inside the circle is good enough.
Once created, the crawling claws will be under your direct telepathic command, so long as your instructions are very simple and you are within 100 feet.
If you leave that area, you must give the crawling claws simple standing orders beforehand.
Creating a crawling claw out of someone's hand does not preclude the use of a resurrection spell to bring that person back to life.
Stories are told of adventurers who were resurrected and later attacked by their own left hands.
Material Components: Clippings from a ghoul's fingernails, and a ring that someone else lost.
