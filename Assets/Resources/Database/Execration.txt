You channel the wrath of your deity through a simple touch, inflicting misfortune on your foe.
With a touch, you impose a -2 penalty on all of another creature's saving throws.
If the subject is also under another effect that imposes saving throw penalties, the effects stack.
At any point before the spell's duration expires, you can force the subject to reroll a single attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check as an immediate action.
You can require this action either before or after the subject rolls, but you must have line of sight to the subject at the time.
The lower of the two rolls applies.
Once this option is exercised, the spell ends immediately.
