You create a phantasmal image of the subject's most hated enemy by sifting through the subconscious mind of the subject.
Only you and the spell's subject can see the phantasmal creature, and the phantasm seems blurry and indistinct to you.
A creature of Int 3 or lower automatically chases after a phantasmal decoy, and more intelligent creatures are likely to do as well unless such action would be obviously foolish.
As a move action, you can move the phantasmal decoy up to 60 feet in any direction.
Because it's not real, the phantasmal decoy isn't affected by terrain that slows movement (although you can slow its progress voluntarily if you like to help maintain the faÃ§ade of realism).
The target gets a Will save if she successfully attacks the phantasmal decoy or moves adjacent to it.
