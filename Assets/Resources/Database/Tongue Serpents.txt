The caster's tongue becomes a little but powerful serpent that he may spit up to 30 feet away.
This serpent then makes a bite attack using the caster's melee attack bonus and dealing damage as a Tiny viper (see the Monster Manual).
The caster may create one such serpent for every four caster levels, spitting each one as a standard action.
At the end of the spell's duration, the serpents become bloody bits of organic matter.
Material Component: A serpent's tongue.
