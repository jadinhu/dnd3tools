You draw forth the material essence of joy from a creature experiencing great bliss.
This physical manifestation of joy, called ambrosia, can be used in the creation of good magic items, as a special spell component, or as a druglike substance (with no addictive qualities).
The Celestial Hebdomad, the rulers of the Seven Heavens, subsist entirely on ambrosia.
The caster draws ambrosia from the target and contains it within a tiny receptacle, such as a vial.
Ambrosia can only be drawn from a blissful creature; how the creature achieves this state of bliss can vary from one individual to the next.
For example, distilled joy can be cast on a deliriously lovestruck character, a dryad dreaming near her tree, an artist crafting his life's masterpiece, or a character experiencing a moment of rapture or undiluted sexual pleasure.
Good spellcasters can use ambrosia in magic item creation.
Each dose provides the equivalent of 2 experience points needed to create the item.
A dose of ambrosia can also be used as an optional spell component (see Chapter 3).
A living creature that drinks a dose of ambrosia experiences a soothing sensation that wipes away minor aches and pains, takes the edge off grief and sadness, and cures 1 point of damage.
These positive sensations and emotions persist for 1d4+1 hours.
Focus: A vial or similar container in which to contain the ambrosia.
