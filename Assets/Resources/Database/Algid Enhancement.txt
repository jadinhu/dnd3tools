You energize cold creatures with a surge of coldfire.
Creatures with the cold subtype affected by this spell gain a +1 deflection bonus to AC, +1d8 temporary hit points, a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 bonus on saving throws against fire effects.
Each of these enhancements increases by +1 for every three caster levels.
So a 12th-level caster grants a +5 deflection bonus to AC, an extra 1d8+4 temporary hit points, a +5 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and a +6 resistance bonus on saving throws against fire effects.
This spell has no effect on creatures not of the cold subtype.
Coldfire Component:One ounce of coldfire.
