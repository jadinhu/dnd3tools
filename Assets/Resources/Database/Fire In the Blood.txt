This unsettling spell enables you to make deadly weapons of your own arteries and veins.
Once the spell is cast, your blood takes on a mystical potency that makes it more corrosive than the strongest acid to anyone who draws it from you.
From then on, until the spell's duration has elapsed, anyone who deals slashing or piercing melee damage on you is sprayed with your blood in retribution.
The blood deals a cumulative 1d6 points of damage per attack upon your attacker, with no save or spell resistance applicable, up to a maximum of 5d6.
Thus, the first time a foe hits you with a slashing or piercing weapon, he instantly takes 1d6 points of damage from the sanguinary backlash.
The second time that same foe strikes you, he takes 2d6 points of damage.
As soon as any single foe has taken 5d6 points of damage in a single spray from your corrosive blood, the spell ends.
Opponents striking you with magical attacks that do not manifest in a slashing or piercing manner, or those striking you with only bludgeoning weapons, do not trigger the retributive blood spray.
The arc and direction of the blood spray is magical in nature, and the spray does not splatter adjacent squares or parties, no matter how close together they might be.
Each spray strikes only the one responsible for the wound.
Material Component: A drop of your own blood.
