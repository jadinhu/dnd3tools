You can form an existing piece of ice into any shape that suits your purpose.
For example, you can make an ice weapon, a special trapdoor, or a crude idol.
Ice shape also permits you to reshape an ice door to make an exit where one didn't exist or to seal a door shut.
While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with ice shape, fine detail isn't possible.
There is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.
Arcane Material Component: Slush, which must be spread into roughly the desired shape of the ice object and then touched to the ice while the verbal component is uttered.
