You make normal or magical fog within the affected area instantly and completely vanish.
This spell is effective against fog and mist from any source, including spells such as obscuring mist or cloudkill, but not against bodies of water, precipitation, or smoke.
The dispelled area stays clear for 1 minute per level regardless of other conditions ï¿½ ;after that, it can fill in again if there is sufficient fog in the surrounding vicinity.
Natural fog is automatically cleared in the affected area; natural fog reform within 1 minute after the expiration of the spell.
Magical fog (such as that from a fog cloud spell) requires you to make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell to clear the area.
The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.
Success means the spell is dispelled in the area you designate, but magic fogs covering large areas might not be completely cleared away by dispel fog.
Creatures in fog or mist form who are in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage.
Even those who make their saves must immediately assume another shape.
