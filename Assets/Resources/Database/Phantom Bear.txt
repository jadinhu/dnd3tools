Fearsome Roar: A phantom bear can loose a fearsome roar every 1d4 rounds.
All creatures except the caster of the phantom bear spell within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 26 Will save or be frightened for 3d6 rounds.
Those who are within 30 feet when they fail their saves are panicked instead of frightened.
Incorporeal Traits: A phantom bear is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.
It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons.
It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will.
Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them.
An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be.
