You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate.
	
An animated object can be of any nonmagical material ï¿½ ;wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, or the like. You may animate one Small or smaller object (such as a chair) or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object (such as a coat rack) counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object (such as a table) as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.
	
The <b>Monster Manual</b> has game statistics for animated objects.
	
This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.
	
Animate objects can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
